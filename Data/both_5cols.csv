3,Peeing Instead of Having an Orgasm Help!,"Hi everyone, I posted this in r/sex but perhaps this might be a more suitable subreddit. 

I've only had one orgasm in my 26 years. It was with a shower-head...but unfortunately I moved and had to try different techniques/tools since then. Fingering, dildos, PIV, even oral all feel great but none of them have made me climax. 

Recently I bought a clit stimulator (which feels incredible). It quickly builds me up but instead of getting me to that big O, all it does is make me pee. It's definitely peeing and not squirting. And once I do pee, all that build up just dissipates. I've tried using the restroom beforehand but it still happens. Once I tried powering through it and just kept going but only went on to pee again...so I'm pretty frustrated at this point and would appreciate suggestions!",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/ewjdt7/peeing_instead_of_having_an_orgasm_help/,1580447735

274,"Is there such a thing as ""menstrual privilege""?","Nowadays we hear about many different forms of privilege, most of which isn't even related to factors anyone can change, but rather based on genetics. Things like ethnicity, skin color, sexual orientation, gender, etc.  Well, does that mean some female-bodied people have ""menstrual privilege""?

This topic came up while talking with one of my coworkers (a cis woman) about what it's like living with gender dysphoria (I have never, ever considered myself a woman, though I do acknowledge my body is female, and do my best to present as masculine without taking hormones). One of her first questions was ""but how can you think of yourself as a guy, when you're suffering from PMS/period cramps/bowel issues/etc.?"" I let her know that I've been having a period since I was 8.5 years old (I'm 33 now) and have never once experienced what most women complain about, so I really am like a male in as much as I can sympathize but have no idea what it's actually like. 

She initially didn't believe me, saying that ""all women get cramps and mood swings no matter what"". But after searching online we found that roughly 7-15% are like me and don't experience any negative symptoms at all. It's literally just a few days of ""oh, I'm bleeding"" and that's it, with a slightly increased appetite, I'm assuming from the loss of nutrients.

My question is, does this count as a privilege? If it doesn't yet, should it? Would it only be considered a privilege in the trans community, specifically for other transgender female-bodied people, as it can help us identify as masculine easier?

Earlier today, I spotted a woman that I've been seeing at the gym for awhile and I kind of have my eyes on her. While I was working out, the girl that I was interested in was working out in front of me within eye view. Now I had another girl next to me that I had spoken to before, and I wanted to say hi to her but didn't. I chose not to because I didn't want to do so in front of the woman I was actually interested in. So I said nothing. Another woman I had spoken to before was right next to me a few minutes later and I chose not to say anything to her either because the woman I liked was within proximity. Am I weird for this?? I guess I'm just being careful so it doesn't seem like I'm trying to talk to every girl at the gym, especially if she might have an interest in me too.

Last night we finally went back to my place. We got naked. I‚Äôm not new to this, I know how important foreplay is. I made sure she was comfortable for a good 10-20 minutes teasing her, kissing her neck, etc.


I went to put my hand down on her clitoris, very slowly,  very gently and I feel her squirm/crawl into a ball. You can tell it is EXTREMELY sensitive.

Sex was not even an option. We got the tip of my pecker in and she began to squirm and I felt like my foreskin was about to rip due to the tightness. 

She tells me it has been 1.5 years since her last sexual encounter. Not sure if I believe that since she is an attractive 22 y/o girl. 

I feel like she might have gone through some trauma or something? She was apologising and I could tell she was insecure about it. 

I want her to know I‚Äôd like to work with her. I just don‚Äôt know why this happens? I‚Äôve had sex with over 30 women and never had one with a clitoris so sensitive and a vagina so tight. 

Should I ask her if she‚Äôs had trauma? Or to accompany her to a gynocologist?

In this post, I'm specifically curious to hear from women that, as far as they knew/know, had or have the opportunity to have children, and have made the decision not to do so. Please share anything relevant that comes to mind about your experience, that you might wish to share with someone that is also considering not trying for children.

The reason that I am asking is not at all from a place of judgement - it's actually the opposite. I'm in my mid-late twenties, and am not sure whether I want to have kids. Some days I happily imagine having 4 kids, some days I happily imagine having no kids. Some days the sacrifices and challenges seem worth it, some days the sacrifices and challenges don't seem worth it. So, I'm basically just wanting to talk to women who have experienced both so I can better understand my own feelings about it. I'll probably make another post asking the same of women that actively decided to try for children.

Went to the doctor right away who took a swab test and confirmed the next day that I‚Äôve tested positive for HSV-2.

Said that it is quite likely I got infected fairly recently given the serious symptoms which he termed the first outbreak as recurrent outbreaks wouldn‚Äôt be as serious. Said I can take a blood test to confirm for antibodies. I was prescribed Valtrex and will be going back to the doctor to discuss suppression treatment.

Meanwhile, had a conversation with my SO who said he never experienced any symptoms but would arrange to get checked. He said he was shocked I suspected him and needed time to be alone to think about the situation. We haven‚Äôt talked in 2 days since then.

538,Safety Tips for a woman who will be watching a ranch (likely) alone for nearly a month in a rural area,"*WARNING: This is a very long and detailed post*

Hello everyone,

I know the title may raise red flags regarding my decision to do this, though I‚Äôm only seeking support and tips to help me feel as prepared as possible. Please and thank you all very much! 

The details:

I am a single woman in my mid-20‚Äôs watching my uncle‚Äôs ranch in a rural area for about 24 days by myself 2 states away from home. I had a friend who was going to stay with me for a chunk of that time, though that doesn‚Äôt seem likely now. He has about 10 dogs and a lovely pig who all sleep in the house with him and his wife. In that sense, I have a feeling of security. In addition, he has a variety of animals both large and small in the ranch that I‚Äôll be with and responsible for during this time. 

I have one major concern about this trip- their neighbor. The land is very spacious, so much so that I can barely see his home, though his friendship with my uncle has him coming around very often. He is in his late 60‚Äôs, a bit stout, and he lives with his mother who he cares for all day, which seems to be the primary thing keeping him occupied. From my past visits, he has made me feel uncomfortable at certain times and has made himself look relatively obvious to even my father and his girlfriend. He has a dog who hangs out at my uncle‚Äôs all day with the others- I feel that he‚Äôd use this as an excuse to show up unannounced. He seems (too) comfortable coming around freely. 

Though I haven‚Äôt felt particularly threatened by him, I am very concerned about the idea of being potentially alone on this property for this long and feel like I need to prepare for the worst.

Perhaps this seems like a foolish decision, though I am going to move out later this year to the state I‚Äôll be in at the ranch late March, and I have the opportunity to check out apartments in which I‚Äôll be living alone in for the first time. They are paying me a huge sum of money which could help me potentially secure myself a place during this time. They are providing me with a car to drive (there are also more on the property that are functional), and they‚Äôve paid for my round trip ticket. I want to take advantage of the opportunity and be able to feel confident and secure in my ability to take every precaution I can to be safe. I am still in search of at least one person to stay with me for a portion of this time. 

Further details about the property and surrounding area:

The two homes that my uncle has on the property and wooden structures for all of the animals are all pretty close to each other, with the property beyond stretching quite aways (it‚Äôs a medium/large plot of land with wire fencing). There are two homes on the property. The guest home is newly built, the main house is two stories and much older. There is a porch light that I believe is motion sensitive, and my uncle‚Äôs talkative companion/best friend parakeet who is either going to be on my shoulder all day and then in his cage at night. There is no way I wouldn‚Äôt know if someone was approaching. 

I am a 5-10 minute drive from the main grocery store, gas station, and other small businesses of the small town. The landscape is relatively mountainous, though we are at a much lower altitude, basically at the base alongside a shallow river.

Mainly, I am looking for tips on how to secure both homes, particularly the one I‚Äôll be in with farmhouse wear and tear, prepare myself within the home (weapons short of guns like tasers, wasp spray, etc.) and other strategies to optimize a feeling of safety and security. I have until March 23rd to prepare accordingly.

I also would like tips on how to repel this person as best I can and draw hard boundaries without provocation if possible. I am open to suggestions from any of the experiences you have had/thought of/believe are relevant and helpful to this, though I want to keep things realistic and practical. 

I want to stress that I am not trying to inflate or exaggerate the situation- perhaps there isn‚Äôt much to worry about, though of course I can‚Äôt not think of the worst (especially with the instances of feeling uncomfortable, unfamiliarity, and further context I need not mention) so I‚Äôm prepared just in case. 


If there is any more I can add, please let me know! Once again, thank you all in this community in advance for taking the time to read this and possibly respond, I appreciate your support üíô",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/enn1zd/safety_tips_for_a_woman_who_will_be_watching_a/,1578833199
539,How do I stop thinking about sex?,"Horny all the time. Need advice

Okayyyyyyy. 
So I (22F) am in a relationship with a guy (25M), let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúK‚Äù.
I‚Äôve been with him since an year. Things have been pretty good with us, we‚Äôre head over heels for each other and I‚Äôm quite happy and satisfied with that. The only thing that has bothered me while all this time is my sexual urges. I think about sex all the time, I have all these sexual fantasies in my mind that I want to do but K on the other hand has low sexual drive. 

In the beginning, everything was okay. We used to have sex all the time but then things changed and now since past three months, his libido has relatively decreased and it‚Äôs been so frustrating for me. I want to have lots and lots of sex. I‚Äôve talked about this to him several times, but nothing has changed. It has come to a point where I start fighting with him over this and feel like having sex with someone outside instead of being with him. 

And yeah, my constant frustration has also led me to masturbate a lot of times and he is not aware of it. 

One more thing, I‚Äôm young and I want to do crazy stuff whereas K is not as adventurous as me. I want to
explore a lot of things but he doesn‚Äôt feel like it. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I love him, I love him so much but I just cannot control my sexual urges. I‚Äôve read some posts here, numerous people have suggested me to focus somewhere else or find a hobby. Tbh, I work 8 hours every day and have stuff to do sometimes when I come back home.

543,Nearly all of my online dating interactions are super scary and I think I'm developing trauma from it all after a year. Have you had similar experiences?,"I've tried OKCupid, Bumble, Tinder and local sites, and most men just come across as extremely pushy, entitled, arrogant and creepy, demanding to meet immediately (usually in a shady place even), requiring naked pics or very quickly being sexual, and whenever I say no and try to slow them the fuck down, they continue insisting and threaten to stop talking with me, so I instantly block them.

I'm a trans woman and I'm open about that in my profile so as not to waste time (a lot of people still don't read my profile though, but when I do make them aware of it myself, they instantly change the conversation towards the aforementioned directions), so I guess most men do not see me as anything more than an easy lay or someone probably desperate enough to sext with them / get naked pics from and then to be blocked.

But this really makes me start to distrust men in general - what if someone were once really good at hiding their true colours and I'd eventually get assaulted or worse (I always meet strangers only in well-lit and crowded public places and tell my friends where I'm at, but yeah), if most do not seem to care at all about respecting my boundaries, nor me as a person in general.

I am mainly wondering if others on here also have similar experiences or if it has more to do with me being trans.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/enmpt2/nearly_all_of_my_online_dating_interactions_are/,1578830841

I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I am content and happy and would like to move away from taking four pills daily (I also take an antacid, and need that otherwise I will have acid reflux). I have heard mixed reviews regarding not taking the pill and your mood changing immensely (for the better), but I‚Äôm unsure if this won‚Äôt work for me due to my Prozac dose? Should I perhaps go to a doctor for a recommendation and see if maybe going down to 20mg of fluox might be a better option? Or do you think dropping the pill is a good idea and then when I‚Äôm ready I should look into going down to 20mg of fluox.. I know I should just go to a doctor but I want to hear real opinions from anyone who‚Äôs been on both at the same time and has dropped one or the other or both.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/enmk3k/prozac_and_birth_control/,1578829618

There's a guy who rejected me... and it hurt when he did, because of the words he used. But he said he doesn't want a relationship, so I sent him some nude picture and he said he'd want sex with me. I want something stable, not just a ONS.

And I'm so horny. But I don't even like him as a person! :( I really don't have good memories from our experience. I was just faking to be fun when I was with him. He's not fun. So I don't want to have sex with him and at the same time I really want to because I'm so horny :( ossshhhh

562,What shall I tell in a job interview why I quit my old job? The true reason is quite complicated,"Hey I‚Äôm pretty new here and if I posted this wrong, please tell me where I shall post it. 

So, after Uni I started working in a company in which i had to fly to Serbia for a week with a male colleague. It were my first 2 weeks in this company, so I thought everything‚Äôs good. 
Right on the first evening he clearly stepped above his borders and it was quiet traumatizing for me. I kept it to myself because I really needed that job. I told myself that I need at least 2 years of experience to move on. Almost 2 years later now, I‚Äôm looking for a job pretty urgently because I would have to work directly with this guy since the company is restructuring and I really couldn‚Äôt bear even hearing him  breath while he was passing me. My boss knows about what happened, but anyways (long story). 
I‚Äôm looking for a new job over half a year now and i always get invitations for interviews, but when it comes to the question why I quit, it always is the same. Either I tell the truth which is humiliating (for me) and they think I‚Äôm one of ‚Äúthat women‚Äù or I make up some basic reasons which aren‚Äôt really convincing. 
I‚Äôd like to ask you guys if you have any advice on how I can solve this situation for the next interview? It will be next week and I‚Äôm already thinking just about that one question.

620,For what reason do some women starfish in bed?," A woman posted a comment on another post saying that women who starfish are doing it most of the time because the man didn't put efforts in making it pleasurable for her. She talked about her own experience with a guy, she basically stopped investing herself when she saw he wasn't invested in her. And she talked about one of her friend's experience, where the guy would complain that her girlfriend was being a starfish, but she told her it was because she expressed to him she'd like him to be more invested but he didn't listen and she basically felt kinda abused many times while he just saw it as her being a starfish.

Anyway I'm bad at explaining english in not my first language.

Basically do most women who starfish do it because some men aren't invested in their pleasure?

735,What do I do about a fellow coworker in a potentially abusive marriage?,"We are all in the military. She (21F) got married to her husband after two months of dating, and within 6 months of checking in to her first command. Husband (separated honorably from our command this year)  has a bad reputation, particularly with other junior enlisted men, for being a ‚Äúslimy fucking tool‚Äù, as my boyfriend puts it. Needless to say, she gets a LOT of judgement from our peers for being a stereotype. 

He‚Äôs shown red flags since before they were married (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not allowed to be out past 10pm‚Äù- this was said while he was living in another state! ‚ÄúI wanted a full sleeve, but I‚Äôm not allowed to get anymore tattoos‚Äù). She came to me last night crying about a fight they got into- he was verbally abusing her. I don‚Äôt know both sides- but you can‚Äôt  berate someone no matter what the backstory is. They fight every 1-2 weeks. She mentioned him watching YouTube videos about ‚Äúcontrolling your woman‚Äù.  He was at the gym while we were talking, and she couldn‚Äôt come to my house because he would have been mad at her, and she was afraid for him to come home. 

I mostly listened, gave a little advice, and recommended the family resource center on base for marriage counseling and tools for teaching them how to communicate/ fight.  A few hours later, she texted me saying that he apologized.

I guess I‚Äôm just kind of torn- I refuse to be an enabler and watch someone be abused, but I‚Äôm afraid she won‚Äôt come to me or anyone (if/when it escalates) if I report  these instances to my chain or give her an ultimatum. Honestly, I am just not trained for this and I feel so lost. My heart hurts.

I would post this to my branch‚Äôs specific subreddit, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs on there.

738,I Resent My Mother and Fear the Future,"I am a 21 year old woman who is really struggling with creating my own life apart from my mother and her personal shame. I love my mom, but the way she lives her life is exhausting and I feel as if she has been drowning me for my entire life. She is a 60 year old woman who has battled with mental health for as long as I can remember. Because of this she has been unable to, in the decade + since divorcing with my father, been able to create a stable living environment for herself or me. 

About six months ago I moved back home from college because I was struggling mentally and also because I wasn't prepared for success as an adult and a student. I thought that coming home was the right decision, but my life with my mother has been very rocky. We're currently facing eviction because she signed a no-pets apartment despite having two. This was supposed to be a time for me to work on myself and learn the skills for success I wasnt taught as a child. Yet i feel like we are at the same place we were years ago. 

I resent my mom a lot even though I have an incredible amount of empathy for her because of her trauma. I am so angry with her that she has failed to be what I need het to be. I am terrified that I am never going to be able to finish school or accomplish any of my dreams because she is like rocks in my pockets in the middle of the sea. I don't want to live her life, but it feels inevitable. I know that living independently would be the best thing for me, but I have terrible credit, student loans and work a minimum wage job.

I get that they're comfortable and I've seen plenty of them that are appropriately proportioned and flattering but not overly revealing.

However, I live in a large urban metropolis and see all kinds of expressions of this fashion.

I did stare or study her, I was walking the opposite direction and it was like ""ok three ladies walking together and that one has her pussy out"".

She was definitely mild mannered and not some kind of street walker, so I wondered if she had mirror checked before she went out and thought about saying her clothes were malfunctioning.  I didn't, obviously, bc I didn't want to embarrass her and getting screamed at for being a sexist or pervert is not a goal of mine today.

So my question is like assuming you liked a guy and there was chemistry and he was generally confident, how much of a turn off would being a 25 year old virgin be to you, and when do you think I should mention it (like should I wait until we get to doing physical stuff or be more upfront about it like on the first date), also how much off a turn off is it if I am like shy sexually at first because of the lack of experience?

I then decided to clean it up by pouring warm water over the area which I think caused, caused a very small bump / pimple to burst, because it bled the tiniest bit. Almost like a blood blister? It only stung the one time I peed over it then it wouldn't sting anymore. Now, my vagikna has bit a bit dry and I think the friction caused it to infect the exact opposite side which was similar to the left side at around the 5'o clock part of my labia minora.  A small pimple burst and secreted the most tinest bit of blood. I continued to clean them with very warm water and took 1 antibiotics (amoxicillin) a day which caused them to heal up continuosly overnight from the 10th until today. They were the slightest bit of itchy and slight discomfort because the skin of the infected areas of my labia minora rubbed against each other when I walked. My discharge is a thick white, though. Could it be an std? Or was it probably just an irritation from my period that affected the glands? Because exactly on the 7th I ran out of pads that I had to use old cotton underwear as a substitute, which would wedgie into my vagina.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/enaje1/can_both_bartholin_glands_become_infected_at_the/,1578764835

828,Help me not be an asshole about my housemate,"I (mid thirties) live with another girl (also mid thirties). Everything is great....except the overnight guest thing. I have a boyfriend who stays over once a week at most - usually once ever 2-3 weeks (other times I'm at his). We're in bed at a reasonable hour and done having sex by 12/1am at the very latest - we both have things going on at the weekend and can't sleep in too much. 

She likes to go out on a Friday / Saturday night and come in at 3am and have sex with a guy until 6 in the morning (loudly) then sleep until 1 or 2pm, wake up and do it all over again. Her bed also bangs against my wall even though I've asked her tons of times to move it just an inch or two back from the wall. The noise is so loud it wakes me up. She once had sex with a guy overnight, then he left and she had someone else come over in the afternoon and had sex with him. I get home on a Saturday afternoon and would like to relax but again...noisy sex prevents me from chilling out.

I'm a bit more conservative in my lifestyle, I guess. I drink, but not too much, I'm active and eat healthy, and have professional goals I'm working towards. On the other hand, she likes to get wasted (and finds it hilarious) and have sex with guys from Tinder into the early hours. I find it frustrating that I am trying to be successful in life and the hours she keeps (and sometimes what she chooses to do in those hours) and having a detrimental effect on that success. I'm writing this from a coffee bar because she has a guy with her and when I got home it was really loud, and I don't want to sit in my living room and listen to all her fuck noises. 

Even though this is stressing me out, I feel like I'm being judgmental and unfair. It's her house too, and if this is how she chooses to live her life, she has every right to. She certainly shouldn't change because I don't like it. I've tried using positive thinking and all kinds of mental trickery to be okay with it, but I can't stop feeling uncomfortable. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I really need some tips on sucking it up and blocking it out.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/en89w8/help_me_not_be_an_asshole_about_my_housemate/,1578754225

830,"She likes me but is still harboring feelings for someone else, what should I do.","I have a female friend who I met earlier this year and really hit it off with. She dated a guy for most of last year and they broke up at the end of the summer, I don't 100% know the details of why or who broke up w/ whom.  We are both in college at a small school and see each other pretty much every day, about a month and a half ago we ended up alone in a room together and she told me she had a crush on me and had been flirting with me for at least a month and wanted to know how I felt. I had no idea probably bc I'm terrible at reading stuff like that but I told her I liked her too. We had a 2 week long weird hookup thing where we were hanging out almost every night and talking a lot.  Then we both went back home for winter break, we had sex on the last night before we left and she knew that sex wasn't just a casual thing for me because I've only really had sex with 2 other girls both of whom I had real feelings for.  She would say she really liked me and initiate things even though she's a little shy and I felt like we had a lot in common and things were going well.  Before break, on the night we had sex, she told me her ex had told her earlier that day that he still had feelings for her and it was bringing up some indecision on her part, but she maintained she does really like me and doesn't want to get back together with him but what he said just brought up memories and she was a little confused.  Break is about to end and we talked almost every day over break sometimes for hours. 

That is until yesterday when she said she wants to take a break and just be friends.  I think things can get lost in translation over text and I tend to overanalyze in situations like this so I just want a third party opinion on what, if anything I can do to handle this.  We had a decently long text conversation in which she first sent kind of like a cliche I just want to be friends for a bit text, then gradually changed over to not necessarily wanting to cut things off but just take a step back. She said she meant everything she said and she really does like me but it's not fair to either of us if her heart isn't fully in it and she ""just wishes \[she\] would have taken a little bit more time to make sure I was over \[him\]"".

I put a less detailed version of this on a more male-oriented forum and all I got was people saying she manipulated me or I failed the test or she just wants to fuck her ex etc....  I do feel like I generally have a good sense of character and I was good friends with her for a few months before anything happened and I don't think she's a bad person; she was upfront and honest the whole time. We both agreed we should definitely talk in person when we get back, what should I say?

832,Does being pregnant really entitle you to be a shitty person at work?,"Got a female manager at the kitchen I woke in. She is about 5 months pregnant and driving everyone up the wall. I get that it‚Äôs a process and she‚Äôs gonna let some hormones out but she has become and absolute tyrant and monster. 

The kicker? I have 7 days left at my job before I move. If I quit they bump all my hours worked down to minimum wage (I‚Äôd lose like $100-200 that paycheck) but it seems worth it. I‚Äôd just quietly tell her ‚Äúdue to your mental instability you convinced someone who had less than a week left to quit, lose out on $150 they already worked for...just to get away from you...that‚Äôs how bad you are‚Äù I know she would cry in the office for like an hour and honestly that‚Äôs what I want. 

I‚Äôm genuinely not trying to be misogynistic but, this is her second pregnancy, from what the other guys told me it wasn‚Äôt that bad the first time so now it seems like an excuse just for her to be bitchy. Normally when she is being uppity (before pregnancy) my GM would reign her in but now that she is pregnant she basically runs the shift even if the GM is there. 

If I quit both of my shift leads said they would give me good personal references and explain the real reason I left the restaurant. 

I‚Äôd gladly make a scene and lose out on a bunch of money I need to move if it means putting her in her place.

So since my very early age I see myself as 100% straight. I always had crush on women and I am romantically only interested in women. However, I do have rarely a fantasy including men. I have absolutely no intentions to act on this thoughts now but never say never. 

The thing is it makes me very uncomfortable to think that I can be aroused by something totaly different from what I used to (I'm in my daily life I'm someone very ""manly"" and competitive, so it goes against my value to surrender to a man.. yeah I'm maybe a little homophobic ?). I feel like less of a man for having thoses fantasy. My girlfriend is so sweet, kind, I love her seriously, but she is so ""immature"" and innocent when it comes to sex that I fear she won't understand.

So my question is, how women would feel if their boyfriend suddendly tell them that they want to experiment with a man, while reassuring them that they are still in love with her and that she always excite her ? Would you have a lower esteem of your companion ?

861,"Woman who become Very Sexually aroused by Horror, I wish to understand why and maybe the feeling the horror gives you as compared to those who do not feel aroused.","So to set this question up im a 6,4 dude and last years Halloween I decided to go as Michael Myers. I recently became a huge fan of the whole series and with how easy it is to be him at least costume wise I go all out.

Get a High Quality Mask, Coveralls , Realistic Knife and Boots.

Now I live in city where every thursday we have a street fair. People sell all kinds of things and a bunch of people show up and walk around this year Halloween fell on Thursday but I decided on top of giving candy out on the big day I would also give it out every Thursday as alot of kids do go to the street fair.

Pack up on a lot of candy and feel excited to hand some candy out. It was a hit. Alot of people pulled me aside for photos and such and alot of people had fun seeing me even the kids who went screaming hehe. Above all though I noticed that quite A few women were..... very flirty. One was walking with her husband and even blew me a kiss. One I remember very well where a group of woman came up to take  pictures and one started Twerking on me. "" Yea get that Knife in her Michael "" they chanted.

This would happen every Thursday and it happened the most on Halloween as that night the Woman I thought were aggressive before were simply Nuns compared to Halloween night women. ""Choke me Mikey"" was the topic of the night. Their words not mine.

All in all it was a fun Halloween and all that happened with the women in the end was funny if not unusual id just never in my life ever experienced something like that before.

The thing though it doesnt stop there the coveralls for the costume are really comfy when I dont feel like getting dressed I just put those on and go about my business. I have 2 pins of Michael on them but even then sometimes is do get advancements even without the mask on.

The last one was when I was at IHOP. The waitress the lit up like a fire cracker when she saw my get up. ""Its just Im in love with the thrill of being chased and helpless to stop him"" We had a good talk.

870,I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs interested.,"So there‚Äôs this somewhat new girl that works in my building. I‚Äôll start off by saying I‚Äôm not usually one to introduce myself/talk to anyone just in passing in the hallways. I‚Äôll list the sequence of events over the past few months as objectively as I can which leads to my uncertainty. 

- First time I see her, I think ‚Äúhey pretty girl in the Building just to get some food‚Äù (my building is one of few that has a cafe on our campus... somewhat irrelevant). 

- we pass each other again later the same week, and she says ‚Äúoh hey I‚Äôve noticed/seen you around a few times :)‚Äù and I mutter/spit something out like ‚Äúoh yeah :&amp;‚Äù I soon find out her office is down the hall from mine 

- another week passes by, I‚Äôm bringing my coffee upstairs in the morning, she has just come in to the building and is behind me and she says, ‚Äúhey I like your socks (I have socks with my dogs face printed on them)‚Äù. We stopped and had a bit of a conversation, I finally formally introduce myself to her as were walking back to our offices. I ask if she‚Äôs new, what department she works in, and we go our separate ways to our offices, ending it with a polite ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you around :)‚Äù

- a few weeks pass by filled with a handful of moments of passing each other in the hallways and saying only hello to each other. One Friday morning, as we pass I say, ‚Äúhey happy Friday‚Äù. Another week goes by and we pass each other again, and she says ‚Äúhey happy Friday :)‚Äù. This time, I stopped to make small talk with her about her thanksgiving break plans. 

Since then it‚Äôs been moments like these, filled with saying hello to each other as we pass, sometimes making small talk about our holiday breaks. A lot of the time I‚Äôm eating lunch on our floor‚Äôs common area and 9 times out of 10, shell pass through and well say hello. There was one time recently I went back out to my car in the morning to grab my water bottle, and as I was heading back into the building, she had just arrived for the day and she holds the door for me and goes ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs your jacket?!?! It‚Äôs so cold out!‚Äù, and I tell her I was just grabbing something out of my car, she says she sometimes sees people not wear jackets when it‚Äôs 25degF out... you get the point. 

Anyway, is she interested and/or am I  over analyzing things?

Had LOTs of ups and downs in the last five years which included cheating on both ends but that was early in the relationship and dealt with and mostly over it. He supposedly is about to come up on big money over growing weed(which I do not hate in itself but not an ideal job imo just for the fact it‚Äôs weed, smoke it but I don‚Äôt want him to make it his job. He already dabs every day and a lot on his days off and I ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HATE IT. Makes me feel like he just keeps wanting to zone me out or something). So anyways, I am worried about him working with those stereotypical weed girls and if they smoke together(which to me seems inappropriate if in a relationship, why would  you spend time getting high with someone of the opposite sex alone). And I know those girls are his type and I don‚Äôt smoke anymore, I rarely even drink now, I simply grew out of it. So from worrying about the money going to his head working with a bunch of girls that smoke weed or him making jokes about having a ‚Äúsoprano relationship‚Äù like his Chris and Adrianna or Tony and Carmella like??? It was funny the first time stfu now. I try to not think about it but he keeps talking about how all this money is gonna come about and he makes those stupid jokes, but he denies wanting an open relationship. I‚Äôm considering leaving him or just finding a side piece if I find out he does and maybe it‚Äôs best to keep secret? Like we both live our lives together happy but have that outside of it? What would you do, I know I sound insecure and untrusting but just from the shit I have dealt with back then to this shit he‚Äôs saying now, I don‚Äôt wanna leave him after all these years but it‚Äôs harping on my mental health.

944,Prenup the second time,"My partner and I are trying to work out the details of a prenup - it's his second marriage and my first. We have a child together. He says everything that's his will remain his; neither will stake a claim to the other's money/assets/retirement funds etc and that during the marriage, we keep our assets and finances separate. Any shared assets post wedding will be divided according to the percentage each partner has put into it - meaning if he puts 80% and I put 20%, I only get back 20% irrespective of the number of years we are married. I think his prenup will be extremely unfair to me especially if we're married for a long time and the relationship crumbles. He earns 8X more than I do and thinks an even split is unrealistic. Sure, but diving up the assets based on who put in what percentage of money is unrealistic too. So, what's the middle ground? Have any of you here encountered a similar situation?

973,What to ask for in a prenup,"My partner and I have been together for several years and have a child. We've thinking about getting married - this will be his second marriage and my first - and he wants us to sign a prenup. He has children from his first marriage and significant assets and inheritance that he wants to protect. He wants the agreement to state that each of us waive any right to spousal support, alimony, pension, life insurance and such. He also wants the agreement to state that any income and property each of us earns or buys in the future be separate and the other not stake a claim to it. While I have no problem with him keeping what's his coming into the marriage, I feel like it's unfair to me to keep everything separate while we are married, particularly if we stay together for years and then divorce.

For some background, we're in mid/late 40s, he earns at least 5x more than I do and we live in a house that he owns. He is a citizen while I have a residency sponsored by my employer. We currently manage our finances separately and while he pays for the utilities, I pay for everything else - schooling, child care, groceries and all other household related expenses. I contribute as much as I can - almost everything I earn goes for the above and as a consequence, I don't have much money to save at the end of the month. I have no debt, some savings in 401k and an $10k emergency fund , but not much else. I will inherit my parent's house, but that is in my home country. Assuming I continue to contribute at this rate, I will not have much more in terms of savings several years from now. I also had to take a significantly lower paying job when I moved to be with him. 

My concern about his prenup agreement is that it will lock me in. Even if we decide to jointly buy assets together (which I cannot currently afford), he thinks it should be split based on how much each of us put in, irrespective of the number of years we are together as husband and wife. While I think this is unfair, I am not exactly clear on what ""fair"" constitutes. I feel that it doesn't take into consideration that this is supposed to be a partnership and that I might have to take a pay hit because his career is more important than mine. I will not stake a claim on what belongs to his children and do not expect a 50:50 split - not even close. But at the same time, I feel that if we are together for a long time, he should have some consideration for what I am left with. If he decides to divorce me 10 years from now, I will have to more or less start from scratch.

1114,I accidentally found some evidence of infidelity. How should I handle this?,"I opened up a shared laptop, went to reddit and thought I was signed in on my account, but was in fact on my wife's. I saw a couple of suspicious dms that implied she might be seeking cybersex. I won't display them because she obviously is an active member, but if you want the exact messages, I'd be happy to private message them.

These messages are dated 2 years ago. About 1 year into our marriage.

Perhaps it was a one time thing of the past, but it's something I feel weird about which means I need to bring it up. We never really had a  discussion as far as 'anonymous sex' boundaries, but we are a monogamus couple, and I've never felt insecure or suspicion about her or our relationship in the past.

I'm curious if you all would consider this type of interaction infidelity, and how should I go about confronting her?

I am in love with a girl who lives in another city but very cloce from my hometown,about 45 min with car.Her hometown is the same with me,but she will live at that city for 2 years because she must have practise-job there from university.

We had a good relationship for about one month,but without having sex,because our meetings during werent more than 3 hours..She was coming every weekend and everything was nice.First time i felt little strange was when i visited the city she lives now for 3 days,i was living at my friend because she never invited me at her home,and 3 days we never meet eachother...

We have done both the mistake to communicate with whats up,messenger etc with messages and not so much with phone calls..

Our last meeting was when we had one month anniversary,was nice,gifts,kisses,hugs etc but again she wanted to go at home after 2-3 hours and my mistake was that i didnt tell her that i wanna go together at my home for having sex and i respected that she was tired...

After that started to be different with me at messages,i felt it,she started answers very typical messages without the love feelling,and she didnt came for 2 weeks...never answering my calls...I asked her whats going on,and she answered me that our relationship is not like she wanted and she wants some time to think...Never answered my calls,only messages and when i asked her at least a last meeting she answered me that she doesnt know  what she wants...

I gave her time,didnt communicate with her for some time until New Year's eve when i sent her happy new year my love as message because she was not answering my call....She answered me,we started a chat and she was describing me like she was describing another man,everything she was telling for me wasnt me...She was telling that i dont take initiatives and i am idle and she cant be with man like that .....I told her that she has mistake,i am not that type of man,we both did mistakes,now we know them and we can make a restart...She said its better to stop it now ...

She has in 5 days her nameday,will be nice idea to sent her a gift that she wanted so much with letter that describes that i love her ,to show her that i take initiatives and i am not idle with her?",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/emr3k5/i_need_an_advice/,1578663881

I have gotten wounds around the left side of my labia. I am talking the size of golfballs. The skin is completely removed and it is just redish and liquid is coming out of it. The fact that I have to wear clothes and underwear makes it worse and it rubs against the wounds, not to mention the pubic hair that is starting to grow back and rub against the wounds when moving. It hurts so bad that I can barely walk or move. Every step feels like a knife. And since I also gotta shower it is hard to let it heal on its on.

1247,What should I (22M) do about my girlfriend's (25F) guy-friend who's in love with her and kinda obsessed?," There's that my girlfriend's guyfriend who's in love with her. I never really bothered about that. I always trusted my girlfriend and her love for me and that she picked me even when she knew his love. And she never really had feelings for him and never saw him as more than a friend. Till that day when she told me about the time they sexted. she told me when she was dissociated and talking some random shit. I was angry about that but I let it go as it happened 4 or 5 years ago and even then she didn't have feelings for him and nothing happened in real life like they never kissed or even hold hands. And I didn't really wanna be possessive and controlling as I'm not that kind of guy. I forgot about that. They didn't talk that much. They barely met. Away from our relationship, he used to stress her by stalking her and forcing conversations even when she blocked him he tried to talk on another application or another way even emailed her. She didn't wanna end their ""friendship"" as she didn't wanna lose him and he's been around for a while and he didn't have a lot of friends and that he's depressed and shit. I didn't really bother all of that as she's an adult and mature enough to make her own decisions and I shouldn't tell her what to do and what not to do. All I did was advise her and give my opinion when she asked for it and it was that she should end this friendship with closure as I didn't like him putting pressure on her and for the sake of everyone as he is hurting too waiting for her love and care so it's not healthy anymore and she's not just a friend for him even when he says that he's not waiting for anything but we all knew that he's waiting for her. It was just my advice not really more and not an order. Up until the day she met him without telling me. Not only that but she also lied to me about it and also sent a picture of her meal showing that she's alone but she wasn't. I knew she was lying. I got my hands on some proof. When I asked her more than once at different times whether she heard anything from him this Christmas she denied anything but she didn't know that I already knew. When I confronted her that I know they met with the proof she couldn't deny it. I got so angry we almost broke up and I already made the decision. She kept crying and asking me not to leave her and that she was afraid and kept swearing that she was going to tell me. I was hurt. But I forgave her because I love her and I know she loves me but she made a mistake and I won't lose much by giving her another chance with making it clear it's gonna be her last chance and it can't happen again. I won't let it. When I asked her why she was afraid of telling me and if she didn't feel safe around me and if she thought I was judgmental, she said no, she feels safe and thinks that I'm not judgmental but she just needed some time. Now a problem happened because of him and we almost broke up. I know she's the one who lied to me but because she was afraid to tell me about meeting him. He asked to see her, and she didn't wanna let him down at the entrance of the new year. Plus she tried to commit suicide a while ago and that's a reason she met him she said and kind of goodbye in case she tries to do that again. But I can't really stand him anymore. Maybe we can make sure that this won't happen again by ending this friendship. I think I can ask her to do that now and she will do it. But should I do it? Or should I let her take the decision herself (knowing that if I leave it to her, she won't be able to do that)?

1250,I am an absolute wreck because of my STD,"Obligatory throw away.  Also a brief disclaimer: yes i immediately went to a doctor, and am getting treatment. This is more emotional, I guess?

I'll keep it short. My bf and I dated a year, We broke up for 1 month. Got back together, and have been together since. During that time I didn't sleep or do anything sexual with anyone. He did with two people. (we're 23 and 24). A few months after we got back together I noticed a small bump on my upper labia. I tell him. Go to the doctor. She's like ""Okay so this is definitely genital warts"". I cry, a lot. I've never had warts and he hasn't shown symptoms. He cries and feels awful that he may have done this. That one (was) is only the one and it's stubborn. Today I noticed I have one near my tailbone in my butt crack.

I've been crying ever since. I feel so so *dirty.* I feel like this isn't my body. I have no one to talk to about this and in 3 weeks it's 8 years since my mom died. I have no female relatives to talk to about this. There's a gigantic lump in my throat, im shaking, and i feel my heart pounding. If a friend told me this thing happened, I'd support and love them and give the rational facts (a lot of people have it, etc) but that doesnt't work on myself....I dont know. Does this make sense? Is this normal?

1298,Ghosted on the day of a date - what could have happened?,"21M here. Recently connected with a girl from high school via Instagram that I had crushes on a couple years ago. Hadn‚Äôt expected anything to come of it but SHE gave me her number after talking on IG for an hour and then we texted for another hour. It was going great so I asked if she wanted to go out. Immediately she said for sure and provided me with times that worked. I chose one and she said that sounded great. We chose a day that was only one day away so I didn‚Äôt text her the next day (normal etiquette once the date is established) and then the afternoon of the date I shot her a quick text seeing if our plans were still good for the night. She doesn‚Äôt respond all day. I go to the place anyways just in case she lost her phone or something and of course she doesn‚Äôt show. I actually call her after the date was supposed to start and she doesn‚Äôt pick up.

This morning I sent her another text telling her I‚Äôm not upset at all and totally understand if something came up and just wanna make sure she‚Äôs okay. Still nothing.

What could possibly make a woman change her mind in 1 day when she was totally down and nothing changed? I‚Äôm seriously baffled and hurt rn.

Tl;dr - Made concrete plans for a date which was confirmed by a woman. Then she ghosted me the day of our day which was only one day later.

1300,Is it acceptable to quit a job via email?,"I‚Äôm wondering if its alright or not to quit a job via email? I recently got a new job and I start in over a week. The job I‚Äôm currently at has a policy rule, that if you quit and don‚Äôt have a job lined up, you are able to finish out a 2 weeks. But if you are quitting and do have a job lined up, you are not able to finish a two weeks and you have to be done immediately. So in my case, I unfortunately cannot give them the benefit of a 2 week notice and just have to straight up quit. I‚Äôm wondering the best way to just straight up quit, for my situation. A recent co worker who quit, quit via email and thought it was appropriate as she was able to communicate her feelings without being talked over and interrupted. The other most recent co worker who quit and tried putting in a 2 weeks( she lied and said she didn‚Äôt have a new job even though she did, just so she could help the company out) only made it 2 days in of the 2 week notice, until my boss cornered her in the break room, basically harassing her about quitting, starting a screaming fight and making my co worker cry and end up walking out for good. With past jobs, I have always put in a two weeks face to face with respectable managers, and I‚Äôm grateful for that as I‚Äôve kept good friends from it and no burned bridges. But with this company, I‚Äôm scared as fuck lol! I just have bad anxiety as it is, &amp; I‚Äôm nervous quitting in person isnt going to end well, &amp; i don‚Äôt know what to do in those situations lol.

That was the worst feeling ever, soon after I tried everything I can do to win her back but I eventually accepted the fact that our relationship will never be the same and I have to focus on myself becoming a person and forgiving her for the emotional cheating part.

I should also mention that for around 3 months we were completely no contact, which has helped me move on and see that, though I love him as a friend, I don't want to be with him anymore.

From his messages I'm not sure if he's just being a helpful friend or if he has other intentions - I'll give a few examples... he has mentioned a few times that he misses spending time with me and sometimes wishes I hadn't moved away. He hasn't overtly said he wants to get back together but some small things make me worry that he might, such as sending me a song that reminds him of me and just generally seeming pretty keen to message me.

I'm moving back to his city next week and he has expressed interest in seeing me pretty soon after I get back, as well as helping me move into my new place. Does it seem like he has hidden intentions or has just genuinely missed me and want to pursue a friendship?

I have 3 younger sisters all a year apart from eachother and they all started their first periods within the last 2 months. When they started my period lasted for 2 weeks straight. I assume it was just our periods all reacting with eachother or something.

I just started my period two days ago and it is extremely heavy. I have blood clots and 2 of them were the size of a plum. I started crying because of how gross it was and I'm scared.

I googled this and it's just a bunch of shit that's stressing me out. I'm going to call the doctor on Monday. About a year ago my mom went to the hospital for hemorrhaging. She had a hysterectomy done because of this. Have you guys ever experienced this? What do I do? I'm so scared.

I‚Äôve been thinking about getting an actual wax since the hair closer to my bottom is hard to reach with the electric razor. I also have been a little self conscious in shorts since they are short shorts and I have to be careful to keep everything covered. Sometimes I get folliculitis but do have a tropical cream from my doctor.

Sooo, should I make an appointment for Tuesday right before I leave to go to grad school?

1682,FAQ Q&amp;A: What is your unpopular opinion?,"Hello, AskWomen!

We have steadily been updating our sub's FAQ to include a great many topics that have lately been coming up with high frequency (and repetitive answers).  New FAQ Q&amp;A threads will continue to go up roughly twice a week until the list is finished.

In case you missed them, the most recent FAQ Q&amp;A threads before this were:


* [How much makeup do you wear, and why do you wear it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8vs8cn/faq_qa_how_much_makeup_do_you_wear_and_why_do_you/)

* [What small details of a potential SO's apartment make a big difference to your impression of them?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8woz07/faq_qa_what_small_details_of_a_potential_sos/)

* [What has been your experience with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and what have been the most useful methods of handling your symptoms?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8xqd36/faq_qa_what_has_been_your_experience_with/)

* [How do you feel about long hair on men/short hair on women?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8ymijz/faq_qa_how_do_you_feel_about_long_hair_on/)

* [What do you think is the most attractive method for dealing with baldness](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8zz9ud/faq_qa_what_do_you_think_is_the_most_attractive/)

These threads will be **HEAVILY MODERATED.** The point is to create an informative repository of answers for questions that get over-asked on the sub, and while AskWomen has never been a debate sub, the No Derailment rule will be applied particularly strictly in these threads in order to make them as densely relevant to the topic as possible. If you want to have an in-depth conversation about someone's answer, take it to PMs.

Today's question is: **What is your unpopular opinion?**

A special note on this topic.  This is a question we have submitted *incredibly* frequently, and it is one of the most difficult to moderate as well, because well... people wanna fight.  While arguments/disagreements are not something this subreddit moderates for, and there are many healthy discussions from opposite points of view on this sub, all too frequently these conversations end up resulting in rule-breaking behavior like invalidation, derailing, personal attacks, and disrespectful commentary. While like all other topics, we will still moderate for all of our rules (including racism, homophobia, transphobia, and gendered slurs).

That being said, we are going to do something a bit different with this post, is that when this thread is taken down from the announcements, only the top level comments will remain.  If you respond to a commentator to discuss their unpopular opinion, it and any comments related will be removed down the chain.  If you want your opinion to be included in the topic to do so, you will need to make sure your comment is a top-level comment, that answers the question asked, and does not derail the topic to discuss something unrelated (like someone else's answer).

  The purposes of these FAQ's are to collect the answers to frequently asked questions, and part of the design of this subreddit is to create an easily searchable (for reddit at least) forum to see the various answers, opinions, and experiences of this community.  So for the purpose of this topic please limit your comments to top level comments, if you wish to discuss moderation please [click here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskWomen&amp;subject=Why+was+this+removed?&amp;message=\[My+comment\]\(https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/92gypf/-/e35nt9k/\)+was+removed+and+I+do+not+understand+the+reason+given+by+the+mod+who+acted upon+it.).  If you do wish to have a discussion with a user you are welcome to try through PM, but be aware of reddits policy regarding harassing PM's.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/92hy0g/faq_qa_what_is_your_unpopular_opinion/,1532737940

1781,What is the probability of the average woman avoiding sexual assault if she fights back?,"Not trying to victim-blame, but the more I read on the male strength, the more horrified I get at the prospect of being a woman. It's awful knowing that you are powerless against half of the population, and considering I already get nauseous by stories of women getting raped while being paralyzed with fear (but tbh, they don't make me feel as weak) getting raped while being unable to do anything about it would make me more disturbed. Sure, I know it's a rarity, and most rapes are date-rapes, but that doesn't make me feel less shitty (doesn't help that I can't exercise without the chances of my aorta tearing open.)

So, what is the probability of the average woman avoiding sexual assault by the average man if she fights back?

Being alone with my tutor and male relatives make me feel immensely uncomfortable; and the idea that I can't gain any muscle without the offshoot of my aorta tearing open doesn't help. The more I read on rape experiences, the more I learn about how these woman tend to freeze up, and Idk, it makes me feel less shitty and powerless at the idea of being a woman?

I put a lot of things off in my 20s because of shyness, depression, laziness, fear, avoidance, and a lack of direction. I wasted a lot of time, and I‚Äôm making up
for it now by studying to get a comfortable job.

I think there‚Äôs an expectation that people in their late 20s should have a career and money. If that‚Äôs true, then I‚Äôm not meeting it and am probably pretty undesirable.

I‚Äôm also learning that the older you get, the harder it is to meet new people, including women. A lot of my peers are in serious relationships, and planning to have / or have children. They‚Äôre also getting married and becoming more insular.

I‚Äôve been using Tinder to try to find a girlfriend, but because I‚Äôm poor and work part time, I think I turn most women off.

I‚Äôm  wondering, is it worth trying to find a girlfriend at this time? 

Maybe I should wait 1-2 years time when I‚Äôll have a full time job and  solid income.

I‚Äôd like to try to find a girlfriend because I‚Äôve been single for many years and basically, I‚Äôm feeling alone. I‚Äôm getting older, uglier, and more bitter about being single.

A man has never picked me up for a date nor chose the location. I also seem to have traveled and experienced more than my date has due to my military background.

As soon I realized it has started I went to take a pill. I don't know how effective this would be but I need to take one today regardless.

2148,"24, single, lost in career and life decisions and ""dreams"". How did you pick between career paths and friends and family and boys?","Please bear with my rant, thank you. 

24, been single for a year. I used to be smart intellectual girl, busy in school, never socialized or partied, and planned to do masters and MBAs and overall just career oriented. But I had a bit of a quarter life crisis where I questioned and got very anxious with all my life decisions.  I felt very lost and got depressed. My self-esteem lowered because I thought if I was really smart, why did I not have it all figured out just yet. 

I did a short term internship that introduced me to the highs of life. I made so many new friends, went out lots, drank a lot, partied, met a guy and we fell ""madly in love"" with each other. I was so happy, I didn't feel depressed anymore. I always had doubts about this guy, but he seemed to be genuinely into me and wanted our relationship to continue, even go long distance for a bit. I used to think about doing a masters after uni, but I basically gave up on that because I realized I liked where I was, and if and when this guy came back, my life would be complete. There were other issues too. My family hated what I had turned into (they are extremely traditional and conservative). They did not know that I drank and did not let me party. And they would've definitely not liked my bf (I never told them about him). Fast forward this guy turns out to be a liar and absolutely crushes my heart within a week of moving away, stating he lost interest and will to make any effort and that we are ""incompatible"" all of a sudden. Honestly, he an immature and childish a$$, but I was too blind and naive to see it then. Maybe that was what he meant by ""incompatible""...
So a year's gone, I am more or less over him, hate him, but mostly hate myself for being such a fool. I was heartbroken so at uni I succumbed to partying and ignored figuring out my career. I was struggling but I couldn't tell my family anything for fear of judgement. It made us all very distant. 
I am now looking to get jobs in my city, and I realize this is not what I wanted with myself. I always wanted to move away, work in another career field. But masters programs all start a year later, and I still don't know what to do and where exactly to go. If I get a well paying job in my city, I might never leave because of the pay and opportunity (which is rare now), and because it is a very different field to what I want to do so it would be a dramatic change. I also then worry what life will be like in another city, will I even be happy in a new place without any friends or family. Am I making a good choice or just trying to look for a change? All the worries get to me. And then I worry about the fact that I will be 25, 26, 27 and single. I worry I will not find a man and waste the ""youthful"" years of my life studying...I do sound crazy now right? I know no other way of finding a man other than tinder or bumble, and I honestly find it rather depressing.
So I realize this: I don't exactly have career goals, I struggle at making life altering decisions, I am having issues with my family, leaving the comfort of my close girlfriends makes me uncomfortable, I think a man will make my life complete and I will alter my life goals for him (because I realize I actually have none...). And I compare myself to the girls who ""have it together"" with their jobs and long and strong relationships. I think I should do what they do, be like them. If I find someone and I want to move, what if he doesn't. Also my family doesn't approve of the type of guys I am interested in, so I feel like I am in a bind in all ways. Find someone they approve of or make my own self happy? What do I do then?

2167,Proposed. She said she'll think about it.,"I asked my best friend of 10 years to marry me last night. 

So here‚Äôs a little backstory. 

I‚Äôm 32 she‚Äôs 28. I grew up with a negative view of marriage because all the married couples I saw growing up resented their partners. My dad married my mom cause she was pregnant with me then they got divorced immediately cause he cheated on her. My paternal Grandparents slept in separate rooms. My maternal grandfather was abusive and my grandma had to leave him. I have met strangers who are seemingly in happy marriages... men who say they love their wives more than anything else but caution me about getting married. So in summation that is why I always had a negative perception of marriage. 

She was raised in a conservative Christian family. Grandparents stayed married. Parents stayed married. Both happily. She‚Äôs always wanted marriage and children and I thought, until recently, I didn‚Äôt. 

For a decade we‚Äôve had a open relationship, a relationship in which we were and still are intimate but sometimes dated other people. It was not traditional at all but we always loved to be around each other more than anyone else. I don‚Äôt want to live without this woman. My experiences shaped my perception about marriage and children but yesterday I decided to challenge and/or let go of all I know and propose to her. 

I asked her parents, whom said they consider me like a son but they said they would rather her marry a Christian than me.

I asked her and she cried (from the shock I think), asked if I was manic and then said she has to think about it. She‚Äôs now asking her friends and family which isn‚Äôt boding well for me because her family wants her to marry a Christian and some of her long time friends don‚Äôt like me, one in particular is a very judgmental religious person.

I want to make this clear, I‚Äôm not absolving myself of any of the pain and confusion she felt and is feeling. I treated her like a queen for the past decade but I made it clear to her and everyone else I didn‚Äôt want to get married and have children. I def gave her bricks to build those walls so her heart could survive being around me, I own that. And I can‚Äôt explain what changed besides me just now realizing I want to see her everyday for the rest of my life.

2206,"How do you shut down a friendly guy online whose pushing your boundaries when you're ""too nice"" yourself?","So pretty simple.

I've gained some online success (paid tyvm) and now I'm finding some people will talk to me for a while and be great conversation and then slowly start pushing it into flirting. (Assume my genre is ""Cooking"", so people will message me asking all kinds of things).

Instead of the cliche DM sliders who straight-up hit on me. I find these guys are trying to build something with me. It makes me very very uncomfortable, deceived and very wary of talking to anyone who DM's me and I don't want to do that because I want to network and connect with my followers you know? I get why they do it - I'm objectively pretty and my platform is very positive. I'm like sugar to bees. (Not trying to sound arrogant but it is what it is).

I'm 1) not interested 2) in a relationship but that shouldn't matter and 3) I can't be mean/firm.

I don't know how to address things like 

""Will you follow me too""

or

""maybe we can chat on the phone sometime down the line""

like btfo, I'm just here to talk about pasta.

So what do you guys do? When a nice guy, who hasn't even been creepy, keeps pushing boundaries?

2249,"For those of you familiar with the Harry Potter series who would you choose, James Potter or Severus Snape?","Spoilers for those who haven't read it. 

Severus Snape was the childhood friend of Lily Evans. Severus Snape was a bit of an outcast and loner. When they both entered Hogwarts they encountered James Potter who relentlessly bullied Severus Snape and made his life hell. James was also popular at school.

While at Hogwarts Severus and Lily drifted apart and Severus fell in with the wrong crowd. Their friendship ended when Severus called Lily an offensive slur. Lily eventually married James when he apparently reformed and stopped being an asshole.

Lily and James eventually died and it was shown that Severus was deeply in love with Lily the whole time.

I personally like Snape and have talked talking to girls when they said they would choose James Potter.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/91pyzd/for_those_of_you_familiar_with_the_harry_potter/,1532506564

If I do go I'd want to get the full college experience but I don't know if I'm to old for that. I'd be a 22 year old college freshman, would it be weird for me to date or hang around other freshman if they are 18?

That difference being women's breasts are sexualized, by both men and women.

I've been bulking for the past few months with a lot of squats, and my ass is now a tad ridiculous. It's not HUGE, but it is *very round* and very jiggly...flexed, and you could probably stack some small books on it. My body is still proportional, my torso is V shaped so even my mid-back is wider than my ass. 

I'm not particularly ""fat"", because my stomach is flat when I stand up, I can still see my abs somewhat in my direct lit bathroom mirror unflexed, and my waist isn't over 35 inches (hoping to start losing 15-20lb in a month when I'm done with this program). Like, when I put on my trousers, there's a small gap between the waistband and my body, but at the back the waistband droops like a V because of how my butt sticks out a bit. 

I've always had a more prominent booty than most. Even when I was lighter. So how do you ladies feel about juicy, meaty, bubble butts that jiggle like the sea during a hurricane? Turn off? Turn on?

My drug is Prozac. I always thought it was only semi-effective; not taking care of all the symptoms, but making a difference. I also have [Bipolar Disorder](https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-1-disorder#1) so I take a mood stabilizer as well.

Last week I ran out of Prozac for 5 days, about 10 days before my period was due to start. **OH. MY. GAWD.** I woke up and my body felt like it got hit by a bus. I'm like WTF it must be all this humidity. Yeah, no. Still sore, no more humidity. 

I quickly became the Wicked Bipolar Bitch of the Midwest. When people asked for my help, I would just straight up say ""No."" I literally picked fights with my fiance (not like me AT ALL). I grew a Buddha-belly of bloat. I sobbed every single night. I even cried at work. I was on edge about literally anything that would cause me the least bit of stress. And I was so SO tired all the time.

I am now back on the Prozac, but it has to build back up in my system and this will take about a week. I am still experiencing these awful symptoms. I need some *serious* advice. Haaalp please.

She has been cutting his hair for years and they are from the same small town. I went with him few times, and their interaction looks is incredibly intimate.  They talk non stop, he makes her giggle, her tits are in his face for good 15 minutes while she is rubbing my mans face ""trimming his beard"", they whisper and make long eye contacts. After they are done, I find out that on top of that he tips her 50% for ""the service"".

Little bit of background on our relationship. Been together 2 years, small bumps  and bruises along the way but we're in a pretty good place right now. We almost broke up couple times, because he has gotten way too close to his female friend to the point where they were talking via text all the time, he would go meet them without me and received nudes from them. When I found the nudes, I gave him an ultimatum, and he chose me. We have gotten over it now, but when I see the interaction that I have described above, it kind of triggers all the old memories and seriously upsets me.

Also he always complains how broke he is or about to be, then we split everything even the tiniest of the bills, i.e 10 dollar coffee shop bill, hence the the 50% tip is outrageous.

2463,I (23m) feel extremely guilty because I want break up with my very insecure GF (21),"A little bit of backstory, she was a virgin before meeting me, she had been cheated on before and found her ex in bed with another girl, this severely traumatized her. We have been together for 1 year and I bought her a ring and a bracelet that she really wanted for our anniversary (I hate anniversaries and think they‚Äôre bullshit but she thought they were special). 

We‚Äôve had a very rocky half year, due to her being extremely jealous to the point of fighting almost every other week because she was either mad I went out with my friends instead of her or she saw that I looked at a celebrity model‚Äôs instagram page and stuff like that, on top of me having a lot of stress at work and struggling with a little bit of depression some weeks.

She is such a caring and sweet person, she loves animals, and would take a hurt pigeon off the street and to the vet. She does everything she can for me, if I feel bad she comes right away. I think the constant fighting over stupid small things like me going out with my friends for once or me not being able to go over to her‚Äôs because I worked 12 hrs straight and wanted to go home and chill by myself have really dwindled my feelings for her and even made me resent her at some point. I don‚Äôt even feel like having sex with her but I can‚Äôt tell if this is because I‚Äôm too stressed or she just doesn‚Äôt do it for me anymore (not physically, I just can‚Äôt get horny because I feel like I have some resentment towards her).

When she‚Äôs on her period or feeling bad, she expects me to be there for her 24/7 and even when she‚Äôs not, we have to be talking almost all the time because she has no job and school is out for her so she stays home pretty much all the time.

A week ago, I didn‚Äôt sleep well and I had a terribly stressful workday with multiple very long meetings that I had to direct, and I am a little bit of an anxious person so that was super hard for me, she was feeling bad and invited me to take a walk (keep in mind her house is 30 min away and I don‚Äôt have a car), so I went and hung out for about 3 hours until I was completely exhausted. We had a good time, laughing and stuff all the way. Then, tomorrow comes, she says she‚Äôs feeling bad again but I couldn‚Äôt go because I needed some time alone/with a friend who lives right next to me (guy) and I went over to his house and just played video games and chilled, she got really mad and threatened me with ending it (not the first time), this has happened at least a hundred times in the past year.

She is madly in love with me, she‚Äôs had some pretty fucked up experiences and traumas, and she is kind of an introvert like me who was bullied as a kid, but her self confidence is so shitty that no matter what I do or say I can‚Äôt help it.

It‚Äôs eating me up inside that I have lost my feelings for her and I have to break her heart and I‚Äôm scared how she‚Äôll take it, I literally am struggling to breathe because of how shit I feel.

2619,"Dear Women of Reddit, have you ever rejected a man if he DIDN'T try to sleep with you early in the dating process?","My entire adult life I've taken poor dating advice, in addition to being immature, where I was of the mind that I have to try to bed a woman on the first few dates in order to win her heart. While this approach has gotten me quite a few one night stands and a failed relationship, I haven't been able to find anything meaningful.

The past few years I have been working on myself, to be a better man and to figure out what I want. I decided that above all, I want a meaningful relationship with a beautiful woman with a beautiful personality. I recently was dating a girl who posesses all the qualities that I look for. She is kind, sweet, affectionate, intelligent and has her own life and dreams. I wanted to do things the right way, and so I did my very best to court her properly. While I never pushed for sex or invite her over to my place, we were very romantic and affectionate with each other from the beginning, and I was very clear with my intentions. The three dates we shared were amazing, and I was hopeful that this was going to work out.

As of late however, she has been unresponsive to my date requests, although she hasn't completely disappeared on me. I'm assuming she is no longer interested in seeing me. Due to some deep seated issues that I have dealt with since childhood, I have always been harshly critical of myself. Because of this, I have been second guessing myself and thinking I messed something up along the way. The big thing that I keep replaying in my mind is whether or not I wasn't properly reading her signals and that maybe she wanted to have sex with me and expected me to initiate it.

 I know that there is no way I can no for sure what happened, and I know I need to be nicer to myself and give myself more credit for trying to be better, but it would help to have some insight here from other women on what is expected of a man in the dating process. Every google search I do tells me that I didn't do anything wrong, but some additional clarity couldn't hurt.

Just started working at a Tesco‚Äôs (supermarket) and the girl (around my age) who was kinda guiding me through thought they were ‚Äòcute‚Äô. Also remember hearing the same thing from a 2nd year student giving a mini tour when I had an interview for uni months ago (she straight up just went ‚Äòaww your dimples are so cute‚Äô when I smiled) and I heard it from my new tutor in school although she was probably doing it more to tease me in front of the class. Just wondering if people find dimples on a guy attractive? I usually get older women in the 30s or something mention them to me and girls my age (18) only really mention them when I‚Äôm drinking with them so I‚Äôm not convinced these dimples really are ‚Äòcute‚Äô aha.

She told me it was the last thing she would want.  I don't need to know her business just that she's safe and has the ability to get somewhere not in the middle of a public place (friends etc).  Maybe she got mugged, maybe her phone fell in the water (she wasn't on it), maybe she got left by someone can can't get home.  

To me walking over and just asking if she's ok and if she needs anything isn't a huge imposition but maybe I'm wrong.  My point was that I read an interview with someone who jumped off the bridge and he said that was crying in public and no one said anything.  Since no one gave a shit he ended up jumping which he regretted but thankfully survived.  I don't want that on my conscience when I can stop eating for like 15 seconds and just be sure.

2866,What can I do to keep my breasts from sagging when I'm not wearing a bra at home?,"My breasts are DD cups, similar to my mothers size when she was my age. However, from a really young age, like, maybe around 12 onward, she started commenting on how my breasts tend to bounce when I walk (even though I've always a slow walker with small strides - I've noticed this too, even today still, and it really bothers me) and how they look like they'll sag, or would just straight up tell me they look saggy. What made my situation more dissapointing was when I tried talking my older sister, an A cup, about my issue. My sister, who has stopped wearing bras completely,  instead of hearing me out, tried to pressure me into not wearing bras (outside of the house) too, and when I tried to explain that it's personally uncomfortable for me and explain how with my breast size I can't afford to not have the support in fear of sag, an issue she doesn't exactly have to deal with on the same level as I do because our opposite sizes would sag at different rates over time, she was just completely unempathetic, and implying I shouldn't be complaining because she would love to have my breast size. After we talked, I did concede to not wearing bras at home, which had been more comfortable. That was about 5 years ago. I'm 22 now still live at home while Im going to college, and for almost a year I've been tying my tank tops tight around my neck to keep my breasts flat against my chest, so that when I'm walking down the stairs or bending over, the bounce and drop of my breast is greatly reduced when not wearing a bra at home. However, I've been getting bruises around my neck and armpit, and don't want to risk getting a blood clot. I's there anything I can do, wear, use, or some kind of routine I can follow, to keep my breasts from bouncing/sagging while not wearing a bra at home?

I've never made a fool out of myself or anything, but I do have a little bit of a hard time coming up with something interesting to say. Sometimes ill stumble over a word or lose my train of thought, ugh. I just wanna be more confident around guys that are attractive to me, ya know? I'm really attracted to this guy right now and he's tried to talk to me but most of the time I retreat to this timid shell. I'd appreciate it if any of you could give some advice. Do you like when girls share their life stories with you or is the mystery more interesting? Do you like when girls initiate first? Anything helps!

3002,Why am I so scared to actually hang out with someone interested in me.,"So I recently entered the dating pool again and started getting matches on tinder and bumble. I hit it off with this girl and we have fun texting, and she keeps saying we should hangout, she really wants to and also expressed interest in having sex too. Every time I get her texts I get this anxiety and fear.

I have no idea why, like Im gonna fuck it up or be too awkward or not know what to talk about or not be good enough or something. I'm pretty insecure about my inexperience with sex and women in general and hate to disappoint people, it makes me so nervous.

3013,"How to make friends or be part of a ""crew"" in your 30s+?"," Hi  all - I recently moved to a large metro area in the south and have been finding it difficult to find a consistent group or crew (or even just a friend) to hang out  with. My social life primarily consists of hanging out with coworkers  for the occasional (maybe once every two weeks or month) happy hour.

Before I moved, it was easy and comfortable to find plans with ""the guys"" to do random activities varying from watching a game to  hitting up the bars but I'm not sure whether it's my age or situation  that's making it difficult to find a consistent group of people to hang out with. I'm not the most social person in the world but I consider myself pretty friendly and have pretty common hobbies with a lot of people my age.

It's hitting me particularly hard this week since it'll be the first Super bowl in my adult that I'll likely be watching by myself since I didn't get any invites to the game and it's been hard to break that barrier at work. From other threads,  it seems to be a common theme that as a guy (or girl) in your 30s it  becomes a lot harder to establish social circles and I'm by no means lonely or depressed but it would be nice to be able to just have even a  couple of guys or gals to hang out with regularly and enjoy some things  that have been more fun doing than just by yourself. 

So  the basic question is: for guys in your 30s or older, how have you  managed to become part of a new crew or had success making friendships  later on in life?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ewi5eh/how_to_make_friends_or_be_part_of_a_crew_in_your/,1580441780

3015,How do you tell a girl who is friends with your ex(?) that you're into her without causing drama?,"So long story short, I was with this girl for 3+ years and have been long distance for the last 2, only seeing each other maybe one week a month. And recently she told me the spark in our relationship had faded and she didn't feel like she was in love anymore. So we're on a ""break""/broken up/not together? I really don't know where I stand with her right now, but my brain is telling me it's probably over. Well anyways, one of her friends has always been into me, like it's pretty obvious and even my ex noticed. I also think she's cute, but I've never said anything to her along those lines while I was in a relationship. So as far as I know, she probably has no idea that the feeling is mutual. I know it's probably not the greatest idea in the first place, but is there a good way to tell her I'm also attracted to her and somehow keep it between us? Knowing that she's also into me, is it likely she'd say something to my ex about me messaging her?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ewi2xv/how_do_you_tell_a_girl_who_is_friends_with_your/,1580441473

3019,What are the most awkward things that have happened to you and your SO or ex that became hilarious or a running joke between you?,"I'll start, the first time I went down on my longterm ex she farted in my mouth, not a queef, a full on fart while tongue punching the fartbox and working the clit. I said nothing not wanting to embarrass her, finished my business and it took her almost two years admit that she had. At that point we were well beyond the fart barrier, it became a great joke between us but not as much as the closet joke. When she finally admitted to it she told me that during early dating when I would go to the bathroom she would go into my closet and fart, wave it, then go back into the room before I came back. From then on when we'd fart one of us would say ""did you hear the closet door?"". Even out or at other peoples houses, we would smell a fart and look at each other and one would ask ""the closet"" to see if it was one of us, it was our code.

I didnt believe her about that last part but when arrived at the shopping center she handed me about 10 grand of ""shopping around money"" then reached in her car and while laughing and smiling at me threw about another 50 grand at me. i was mad for a second because i had something thrown at me,but then realized it was my now GF playfully throwing 50 bands at me and quickly became un-mad. We walked around and she was getting tons of attention due to the fact she was gorgeous and filthy rich with her parents money, she was apperantly well known in the town. there was a TON of jealousy and people thinking i paid her to walk around with me to boost my own personal standing (yea i payed girl with money like that to follow me right?)

I like being friends with older guys because they're usually quite chill and we can talk about all kinds of interesting things. 

I like my younger friends because I find them quite funny and they show me cool shit (newer music and other entertaining things). I'm not quite out of my ""party hard"" stage either so I appreciate their friendship. 

My older friends are quite settled into their lives since they have wives and kids etc, while my younger friends are sowing their wild oats. Meanwhile I'm just kinda in the middle of these stages.

It's weird and I'm just wondering what people think about this?

Also when washing my face should I also be washing my neck and beard with the face wash?

3221,How come some dudes act the way they wanna act and look cool and others repulsive and annoying?,"I noticed that it's not even about how tough and good looking they are, but it's about that one thing. 

Something that makes them look just so likable that if they say or do something super messed up they will make you laugh or say/do it, in way that you won't even think that what they are saying/doing is wrong, but support them instead. And when you are around them you just have this feeling that this person is dominating you and everyone around in every way possible. You just have the feeling that if you hit this person something is gonna happen to you afterwards. And for the most of the time you don't really feel like hitting him, because you just get that weird feeling of respect towards him. It's like if this person starts judging you, hitting you or whatever you will immediately start feeling guilty about yourself. It's like even if they have at the moment less money than you just have this one feeling not to mess with him, because tomorrow he might have more money than you and you kinda feel jealous about his struggle.

Then there is the other kind of people who just don't have this one thing and when they act in a way they wanna act they just look annoying, narcissist, creepy and just in general repulsive. When they say or do something messed up they will be judged right away for their decision. And when you're around them even if they are bigger, richer and sometimes more good looking than you , you just don't feel any dominance from them. It's like you can do anything with them and even if they end up beating you up for it you won't really feel the guilt for it. Basically the opposite of the thing I wrote above.

How is this charm achieved? Or to be more specific, how do you become the person above in any circumstances, because here is my situation: To some people I am the confident person mentioned above and some of them actually asked me a similar question that I am writing here. However to some people I am the repulsive guy mentioned below. And I am curious when someone just gives me this attitude that he is more dominant than me or that I am a repulsive person, how do I fight back to it and not let myself be viewed as someone less dominant, repulsive or even worse - beta?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ewayad/how_come_some_dudes_act_the_way_they_wanna_act/,1580413161
3222,advice: guy i‚Äôve recently started dating told me he‚Äôs in a funk. how can i be supportive?,"He hasn‚Äôt been communicative this week, which is odd because he calls me almost every day and I just spent a wonderful weekend with him. I texted him Monday asking if there was anything wrong, and he said he was just in a funk. he called me Tuesday night before bed and talked for a short bit about the next time I visit (we live in different states), and I asked him if he was better, and he said he was a little bit. The next day (yesterday) I asked him if I had done something, and he said no, not at all, that Kobe Bryant‚Äôs death struck him. 
So, now that I know that what‚Äôs going on has nothing to do with me (unless he‚Äôs just scared of how well things are going and didn‚Äôt say that) and is to do with his internal or 3D environment, how can I best support him? I‚Äôm a recovering codependent/love addict, so I want to hold space for him to experience whatever it is he needs to work out without feeling the need to take on the responsibility of ‚Äúfixing‚Äù him and being overly there for him.

3274,"How do I work on increasing confidence while also not being so ""try hard"" and over analyzing?","I am a 29 yo man. I've made a major shift in my life over the last six months or so. I've been single for about 7 years and decided it was time to actually put a little effort into changing that. I never felt ugly but I also knew that women weren't going to be beating down the door and I was going to need to put in some effort if I wanted to find a mate. And I was okay with that for a while because I was totally obsessed with other things in my life.

So more to the point. Dating and increasing my confidence has been my new obsession over the last 6 months or so. And I've come a long way. But today I noticed something that I haven't noticed before.  I care way more about about how I look now. Which...im not so sure is a great thing some days. Sometimes I feel really confident and other times I feel completely unconfident and down on myself. I realized that I'm so hyper focused on what I look like now and other people's perception and reactions of me that I think it's starting to have the opposite effect. I'm constantly analyzing every little detail when I look in the mirror and now that I'm actually paying attention I'm noticing all the lack of attention I still get from females even though I feel more confident in my appearance.

I've heard it said that ""being comfortable in your own skin"" and not caring so much what others think is attractive. So I feel like I'm at a weird place right now because obviously I do care what people think or I wouldn't be stressing so much about my hair cut, my clothes, cologne etc etc. I hope this makes sense...

I know I am sounding a bit cheesy but trust me I am speaking honestly. For me it was like love at first sight but the problem is that I am a below par kind of guy in all aspects of life and she is the exact opposite of me. I tried talking to her but I could not come up with any words let alone  form complete sentences so I took the route 1 for introverts and started chatting with her on Facebook, well replies were pretty sporadic and I spent nearly a year like that .  I recently came to know that she has a boyfriend so I was little sad but I always have this one hope of getting her one day. One day someone told her close friends regarding my feelings for her and they confronted me as a result I had to tell them regarding my fondness for her. Recently after 1.5 years I mustered the courage to talk to her but I got to know that her friends who confronted me told her everything about me and also that I have told them to do so. Now she thinks I  don't have courage(which is somewhat true) and I resort to these cheap tactics(which is not at all true). Now I don't have any clue about what to do as she knows the truth but with some wrong things also. Now she avoids me more and she was feeling totally awkward last time(the only time) we talked.

3323,"Men of reddit, how do you treat a girl like you want to date her?","I'm a 19M and I've never been in a relationship. With all the girls I've known I've only been in completely platonic relationships with them. The majority of my close friends in life have been girls so I'm stuck in that kind of behaviour around anyone of the opposite sex. The only way I know how to interact with a girl is to treat them as I have any other girl in my life - as a friend. This has inevitably led to many friendzone situations. I have very little clue how to get a girl to see me as a potential partner. 

During my time at school and here at university I have of course crushed on girls that I met and then talked to after on several occasions but I never know how to take things to the next level or how to gauge if they reciprocate my feelings towards them (I know the latter one is difficult for everyone).

3329,How to get dates?,"I recently got away from a toxic relationship of 9 years on and off (AMA but that's not the point of this post). I am 23 so I have basically no experience dating and pursuing new attractions. I feel comfortable with 1 on 1 social interactions and would love to go on dates and have some fun meeting new women (not really looking for casual sex but I'm open to it). So I have no anxieties about how to behave on dates, however I am finding it extremely difficult to actually *getting* girls to agree to, and follow through on going out with me. 

I do not feel comfortable approaching women in public, partly because I don't want to be seen as creepy and make anyone uncomfortable, but also because there is largely nothing I would want to say to a random stranger that may lead to a date. So I've been mainly using things like tinder. Most of the time women will either not show any interest, or stop showing interest when I bring up the idea of meeting irl. I am incredibly busy with school and haven't had time to try random social activities where I may meet people.

I always knew I wanted kids, and now I have three of them and they're awesome, might even adopt another one someday. 

The issue is that I don't feel like I can interact with them at all in public. If some little kid waves at me in the grocery store or even Disney World, I don't feel I can or should wave back. I've had a few times that were definitely negative experiences. I was at the grocery store and some kid wearing a Pokemon shirt was watching me catch Pokemon on my phone. He was very clearly thrilled by watching this, pointing at it to his mom and such, so I held up the phone and showed him what I caught and the mom turned the cart around.

I felt this was a possessive thing borne out of insecurity and did not accommodate his feelings. I felt he should trust my judgment that there is no threat from that friendship (and other friendships). 

I eventually ended it because I felt our ideas about love and intimacy were not aligned, and I was not convinced I should change my friends or cut them off just to please his ego. 

He often argued (very weakly, I might add) that I do not know ‚Äúhow men think‚Äù and therefore should trust his judgment.

3376,(Ugly) Men of Reddit: How do you handle low self-esteem and anxiety before first dates/meetings.,"Sorry for the long post, TLDR at the bottom.

I recently just graduated from University. I've never really had much luck with relationships, after a while I decided to just stop trying and focus on my studies.  Recently I got a dating app and I met this genuinely amazing person literally the first night. We've been talking for a while and it's actually ridiculous how much we have in common, same indie music, favourite movies, even read the same books right before we met. We also had similar dating pasts and are looking for the same thing, she also told me I'm the first person from that app she gave her number too.

Anyways, it's been a week since we've started talking and she's been really pushing meeting irl, we live close enough together so It won't be that much of a problem and we've been talking pretty much every day, even started watching a series together every night while texting. We talked a bit about what we're looking for from dating/relationships and neither of us are too rushed for anything, we'd much rather prefer just spending time and enjoying each others company, likewise, we're not that pressured to jump into a relationship if stuff doesn't work out, and I'd be more than glad to remain her friend if that does happen.

However. I'm a couple of days away and have this overwhelming fear that when we meet everything will change. I've had horrible self-esteem ever since I was a teenager, granted I was probably an ugly kid and bullying happens everywhere but it's shattered some reasonable expectations within my life. She called me cute and awh'ed here and there but whenever I try to compliment her, granted rather jokingly, she'd respond with something like ""lols"" or the likes, it makes me feel stupid for doing so. I tried sending her more ""unedited"" pictures to see if maybe seeing more of me would trigger some sort of reasonable reaction that she's out of my league but she never really comments on my looks, which I mean, is fair, I'm not fishing for compliments, and the pictures usually have other purposes, like showing a haircut etc.

Based on how the conversations and stuff is going we obviously like each other, but I really don't want to meet, if not for all the reasons I listed purely just to not ruin whatever it is that we have, I really like her if you haven't figured out, and I think she's ridiculously way out of my league, it's not even remotely close. And even now I have no idea if she actually finds me attractive, and I wouldn't wish for her to try ""date"" me if she doesn't, I think attraction is a healthy part of any relationship.

I guess what I'm asking is how do you guys get over this. Are leagues something someone should really worry about, it all feels so dumb but a simple ""looks don't matter"" really isn't helping right now, I'm not sure what to do, I think cancelling so close to our meeting would be rude, and me telling her how scared I am might seem too weird/might make meeting weirder for her.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I met this amazing girl and we've been talking for a week. She's insanely attractive/ I'm not/ and we have a lot in common. We've both sent the other some pictures, and whenever I compliment her she replies with ""lols"" or something similar, likewise she doesn't respond to my looks in any way but instead calls my personality cute etc. I really don't want to meet for fear of ruining what we have, Men of Reddit, how do you handle such anxiety/lack of self-esteem before a date, I'm genuinely scared us meeting would ruin everything.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ew34p7/ugly_men_of_reddit_how_do_you_handle_low/,1580378651

I Always use to shave my head and felt care free. It helped with my confidence gave me a care free mentality that became apart of my personality and made me more approachable looking back.. and I like the bald head feel but things happened in my life and I got diagnosed with depression and panic phobia and I just stopped caring and wanted a change. I was called pretty boy a lot at jobs with a shaved head and even though I laughed it off I didn't like it much I guess it stuck and during hard time it made me want to see a different person in the mirror hoping it will help.

I found out I had curly hair which didn't help but made me more curious.. and i Wanted to experiment and feel more InTouch with my natural side In hopes I can ""find myself"" easier.. I let me hair grow and got it cut inbetween but my hair grows in such an awkward twist fashion around my head that it's almost impossible to get it cut right and it's always uneven. The girl that's cutting my hair keeps telling me she can't do much without it taking its natural form before layering it so I'd have to deal with the awkward stage for half a year. While it was growing out at first I got compliments and it helped me play a more laid back goofy me and I tried to own it but now I just feel and move insecure and I'm being talked to like im mentally ill by strangers or get looked at as someone who is trying to hard because I look off (could be my insecurity). I'm also wearing Invisalign which is straightening and moving around teeth which prohibits me to talk as my normal self so words are coming out sounding different, just a bad look all around. Dealing with depression makes it worse but some people close to me want me to keep growing it out.

There‚Äôs a guy who posts on a lot of the same forums that I do, and I interact with him sometimes but I mostly just thumbs up his comments because they‚Äôre funny. We both have profile pictures but neither are really flattering (I‚Äôm not attractive in mine at all)

Turns out that I have a class with him this quarter and even though weve had five sessions of that class he just recently messaged me asking if It was me.

By texting me to ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù that it‚Äôs me, does that mean he wants to start talking to me in person? 

Neither of us have even made eye contact or anything and I can‚Äôt ignore his message (social anxiety) and continue to pretend to not notice him but I‚Äôm really awkward and not sure if I want the stress of trying to make a new friend.

3396,How would you handle a situation in which you suspect your friend has a crush on your girlfriend?,"My friend/roommate made some comments tonight about him having a big crush on her, but he's playing it off as sarcasm. When I tried to get semi serious with him for a second he said he was just joking, but my other roommate and I both agree that this is exactly how he'd act if he really felt this way, and when we confronted him about it he just acted like we're overreacting at a simple joke. Lately he's also been talking about how lonely he is since he broke up with his girlfriend recently, and he's talked to my girlfriend about this too. She's one of the nicest people on Earth, and we've all been friends for a while, but I've always been of the opinion that a single man (especially a lonely one) cannot be just friends with a woman, even if that woman is dating their friend. Extra worrying because that's how I got my current girlfriend. I became friends with her when her relationship was bad, and she left her boyfriend for me. So yeah I've been pretty honest with her about my opinion on that sort of thing. 



I've been suspicious of this happening for a while since we can't really avoid hanging out with him when I take her back to my place. Our relationship is pretty healthy, and I don't think she's lying when she tells me I'm her best relationship she's had. She did cheat on her high school boyfriend years ago, so that sticks out as a red flag, but overall I do trust her.

I'm actually not really worried about my friend doing anything right now because he's a really nice, loyal dude (not gonna lie, it's strange that he's single, he's a really solid catch), but I'm also not stupid, and I know how feelings develop. I don't think she'd be mad if I brought up the possibility of him having a crush, but she might (probably unlikely at this point) disagree and think their friendship is harmless. Although if she did say that I'd probably dump her right there because I'm pretty sure she's had sex with every guy ""friend"" she's ever had, and was even friends with her ex for a while. I'm more worried that it would put her in a weird position where she can't really do anything.

I guess I'm just wondering if I should say something based on a strong suspicion, and if I should, who should I go to first?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ew2k1u/how_would_you_handle_a_situation_in_which_you/,1580374725

I deeply regret this decision, but obviously she won‚Äôt get together with me. I‚Äôve accepted that she doesn‚Äôt want me anymore, and I‚Äôve taken all the needed steps to rebuild myself as a person. I‚Äôve surrounded myself with friends, I‚Äôve started therapy to help cope with my anxiety, stress, and response to those emotions, I put myself in new and uncomfortable situations all the time, I‚Äôm meditating, I‚Äôm working out, and I‚Äôm focusing a lot more on my studies. While my general mental health feels better than ever, I‚Äôm still really in pain. 

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about wanting the relationship back, and I feel like a lot of what I‚Äôm doing to better myself isn‚Äôt even for me, but it‚Äôs just in hopes of impressing my ex to get back with me.

He‚Äôs a wonderful man, and we‚Äôve been through some intense highs and lows in the three years we‚Äôve been together. We decided to stick together and make it permanent.

I‚Äôve been wondering a lot though... I‚Äôve seen very few relationships stand the test of time. My parents split, my grandparents split, every aunt and uncle, most close friends I‚Äôve had... it seems like everyone eventually gets divorced. 

It‚Äôs very discouraging to see people make the leap, trusting each other with their hearts, bodies, homes, family and finances, then fall apart.

Marriage seems like a particularly bad deal for men. Not that I‚Äôm the type to chase him down for half his stuff if it doesn‚Äôt work, but a lot of women do. And don‚Äôt get me started about the legal issues that get kids taken from their fathers. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.

So here‚Äôs my question. With all the porn and the free, no-strings attached sex available to handsome, charismatic men (like mine), and the active role society plays in striping a man of his wealth and children if things don‚Äôt work out, why do men get married?

3486,How would you feel about dating a woman who works part time because of mental health issues?,"28F with diagnosed bipolar and anxiety disorders here (the bipolar is mostly under control with meds and therapy, so it‚Äôs mainly the anxiety that‚Äôs the issue). I only work a part time job, because I get overwhelmed working too many hours. I‚Äôve been working the same job for over 3 years now, and although the pay is low, I really love this job. I do hope to work full time someday, but I don‚Äôt feel ready yet, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt know if I ever will.

I was in a relationship for almost 5 years until last year, when my ex broke up with me. We had been talking about moving in together, but he wanted a certain lifestyle that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford on mostly his income. For the record, despite him making about 8x my salary, I paid for all my own meals and date activities for the whole duration of the relationship, so I‚Äôm not a leech or looking for a sugar daddy. I even paid for him occasionally, because I felt it was fair, considering he did all of the driving due to my driving anxiety. I tried to contribute to the relationship in other ways by doing thoughtful things for him, planning free or cheap dates, etc.

I'm 26 and a nurse. My average weekday routine (Monday to Thursday) is waking up at 6am, studying until 8am, getting to work for around 9. Home from work around 3-4, an hour or two of charting, off to the gym and then dinner with the wife. Wednesdays are weekly dart nights with the boys. 



Weekends that I don't work (Thursday-Friday) I'm up by 8, at the gym by 9 and back home around 10. Make a big breakfast, spend a few hours studying, then figure out how we'd like to spend the weekend. Sometimes its daytrips, parties / events if there's anything going on, or a weekend trip to Toronto to visit my good friend. Most weekends we're productive-ish in the day, then as soon as its dark we like to get stupidly high and play videogames or watch a movie. Summers are similar, except I play baseball twice a week.

What I‚Äôm wondering is the flip side: guys, when you know or suspect that a female friend is into you, but you‚Äôre NOT interested like that, what do you do or say to communicate that? Do you act any differently?

Let‚Äôs assume the guy in question is interested in women and not in a relationship, because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have a girlfriend/partner/SO‚Äù seem like obvious solutions to this problem, but they may not always apply.

I ask because as a woman, I recognize a lot of the different ways women hint or signal to men ‚Äòjust friends‚Äô or ‚Äònot interested,‚Äô but I don‚Äôt know what it looks like for guys in that situation.

I really like my bf, I'm aware of how complicated a relationship with such an age gap could be and I know it has more chances of not lasting long, but I just want to enjoy things till they work. 
I know his friends and I are in different phases of life and that we don't have a ton of thing in common (e.g. they work while I study, they live on their own while I'm still at my parents house...), so it could be more difficult to become part of the group. However I want to be part of my bf's world and he wants it too, so I think it's very important to find a way to get along with his fellows and their gfs. 
When I met them I felt that on the one hand they kinda disapproved our relationship (I can understand it, I know age gap relationship have to face social disapproval), but on the other they pointed out pretty often how happier my bf seemed since we started dating.
I don't know how to behave

I'm (17F) currently dating a guy (18M) who has liked me for almost 3 years. We were classmates in 9th grade but I went to a different university after that so we haven't seen each other for more than a year and a half. 

I used to date girls before and it's my first time dating a guy. I asked him out after the new years eve and he was very excited about it. 

So basically, I was his first date and I also initiated his first kiss. I looove hugs so I hug him all the time and I like to wrap my arms around him from behind and do the awkward waddle paddle walk. I did all of the first move since he was too shy and had no dating experience.

Seems like totally legitimate reasons, but it also feels weird to ask her out to something else after it not working out these past two times, 

Unsure of how to procede, should I ask her if there is a time specifically she is available to work better around her schedule, or just leave it be.

Feels desperate to ask a chick out 3 times, but she was definitely into me when we were hanging out before. Specifically said she had a lot of fun and said we should hangout again.

I sorta just wanna be straight up and ask if shes about it, or if she changed her mind or something and doesnt want to hang out anymore, just seems like an awkward thing to say.

For context she's a 22yo grad student and college kids aren't exactly known for their culinary expertise.

Sorry if that sounds really harsh but I can't tell her that. Might immediate reaction (after prepping myself by taste testing when she wasn't in the room) was to say I need to teach her how to make sauce.

In my defense this food is inedible. I just don't know how to console her or respond to the ""everyone else likes it"" when there's no way that could be true.

so i (27F) have been casually seeing this one guy 29M for the past few weeks. first date went well and we set up a second, which went well too and ended with us sleeping together, and led to a third date that ended the same way right before the holiday season. 

holidays came and went and we've only been able to see each-other once since then and he literally just invited me over to his apartment to have sex. ü§∑

no shame in that but in-between then there's been some sexting and a little bit of texting but tbh we've never texted much, only to make plans to hangout. 

what throws me off is that this guy got out of an 8+ yr relationship like 7 months before we met and i'm the first person he's been with apparently. 

so my question is ‚Äî does this come off as some kind of casual thing or more of a rebound booty call thing?

I struggle to not eat out every chance I get and I'm spending way to much money on useless shit. I have no self control anymore. I masterbate once a day and think about sex way to much. I've been simping over the same girl that's terrible for me for 2+ years now. I cant get my self to consistently start working out. I'm on social media way to much. I'm sick of working customer service, some people are just so mean and dont understand I have no control over anything.I still feel like I have undiagnosed ADHD and to afraid to ask my parents to take me to the doctor for it, and I wouldn't say I'm suicidal but death is constantly on mind.

Maybe lately I was too available for her and It probably annoyed her. She made me also lose trust, and made me like controlling and suspect her I admit it's not good any tips for that? Let me know please. 

It let to her respond slower at first, and not answer calls directly.

So I talked about it and she now suddenly tells me calling every day is not right and that she didn't want to see me every day and also she was bored and easily irritated. I told her you need space? She tells me no, I'm not taking space from relationship and tells me ""I always love you"" but i know she is also influenced by her sisters and talking about me behind my back.

She became emotionally distant.

Is she testing me to see if i can live without her?

""Remember before it all happened it came in stages and this is the aftermath""

Day 1: Almost no response 3 times maybe. And a 1 missed call of her just because i wanted but she didn't look interested. I called her later  instead and a pop up came she was in another call and she still didn't respond to my text. So I called her out, called her ""devil"" for treating me like this and then ""she"" wanted to throw a tantrum for me saying that it took her very long to reply. The next day she says I wasn't on a ""call"" later she admits she called and tells me it's not a boy or something like that but ""someone important"" childish right?. I think either she was testing me or something really happened.
On this day It took her hours to reply at certain times. Sometimes 5 or 6!!! But I didn't feel any remorse because basically it made me think she is not worth it and i accepted mentally that she isn't my girlfriend anymore. And shockingly when watching a random youtube video, and saw a girl talking and my brain said this: that's what my ""ex would think"" i said it unconsciously to myself.

So i told her why are you still behaving like that? She told me I'm not gonna break up with you and I am not seeing someone else. ""But i don't believe it"" I don't really care that much anymore, because she pushes me away. And to be honest i am more hurt for getting treated this way.

Day 2: I wasn't gonna initiate any texts anymore. We didn't even talk or something but she kept me up to date sometimes on what she was doing and more then the first day. And tells me at the end of the day, sorry that I didn't have much time for you,""I love you always"". (I got really pissed because it isn't true) but I held it in me, and told her kindly just goodnight."" She tells me I call you tomorrow. But i am not excited at all to see her and feel like ignoring or maybe worse breaking up. I know that even if she will call me, she would still be slow responsive and not call me everyday and treat me like dirt.

Conclusion:

1. She says im not taking space but she isn't putting any effort into relationship, But she tells me she isn't. Is my girlfriend trying to convince me her behaviour is normal? We used to call every day and text eachother because we are in long distance.

2. Any hope left of her behaving like she used to be? Is this a phase?

I didn't have problems with us seeing often because of the distance. But it isn't right. I cannot see the person ""i love"" but she clearly is not the same anymore.  She just told me i love you and i always do. But words is nothing, it's just words it doesn't make me feel in love or give me hope. Because of the way i get treated i find it manipulative and abusive is she abusing me?

I know it's not true what she says and how she behaves. It's like she is changing the rules for her own favour and I feel tested.

Any advice?

3789,"What's your take on this list titled ""Men, you want to treat women better? Here's a list to start with.""?","Talk to your friend who is ‚Äúkind of a creep‚Äù at work.

Don‚Äôt talk over women.

If you are asked to be on a panel/team and see that it‚Äôs all men, say something. Maybe even refuse the spot!

When you see another guy talk over a woman, say: ‚ÄúHey, she was saying something.‚Äù

Learn to read a fucking room.

Don‚Äôt call women ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù in a professional setting.

Don‚Äôt use your ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù as a way to get women to trust you. Show us in your day-to-day life, not in your self-congratulatory social media.

Don‚Äôt touch women you don‚Äôt know, and honestly, ask yourself why you feel the need to touch women in general.

Do you feel that any woman on earth owes you something? She doesn‚Äôt. Even if you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúHm, but what about basic respect?‚Äù ask yourself if you‚Äôve shown her the same.

Don‚Äôt send pictures of your penis unless she just asked for them.

If a woman says no to a date, don‚Äôt ask her again.

If a woman has not given an enthusiastic ‚Äúyes‚Äù to sex, back the hell off.

If a woman is really drunk, she cannot consent to you and she also cannot consent to your buddy who seems to be trying something. Your buddy is your responsibility, so say something and intervene.

If you do the right thing, don‚Äôt expect praise or payment or a pat on the back or even a ‚Äúthank you from that woman‚Äù. Congratulations, you were baseline decent.

Involve women in your creative projects, then let them have equal part in them.

Don‚Äôt make misogynistic jokes.

Don‚Äôt expect women to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù or ‚Äúcute‚Äù and don‚Äôt get upset when they aren‚Äôt those things.

Don‚Äôt make assumptions about a woman‚Äôs intelligence, capabilities or desires based on how she dresses.

Pay women as much as you pay men.

If a woman tells you that you fucked up, and you feel like shit, don‚Äôt put it on that woman to make you feel better. Apologize without qualification and then go away.

Don‚Äôt punish women for witnessing your vulnerability.

Don‚Äôt get defensive when you get called out.

Don‚Äôt need to literally witness a man being horrible in order to believe that he‚Äôs horrible. Trust and believe women.

Don‚Äôt use your power to get women‚Äôs attention/company/sex/etc.

Be aware of your inherent power in situations and use it to protect women, especially via talking to other men.

Stop thinking that because you‚Äôre also marginalized or a survivor that you cannot inflict pain or oppress women.

If women‚Äôs pain makes you feel pain, don‚Äôt prize your pain above hers, or make that pain her problem.

Don‚Äôt read a list like this and think that most of these don‚Äôt apply to you.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/erz8z2/whats_your_take_on_this_list_titled_men_you_want/,1579633374

I (23F)  am going out with this guy (26M) for around 3 weeks now. We've met around 5/6 times already and had sex on the second date.
He's pretty nice, handsome, sweet etc. We get along and being spending some pretty nice time together. 

I need advice with: 
1 - everytime we had sex I would not know when he cums. Like he don't say anything and also I really can't tell lol so happened some times that I am there on top (which is super often bc I really like it) and then I asked if he cum already and he says yeah? But then means we were having sex with the condom filled which is not safe and weird lol any advice of how to talk to him and any ideas of why he doesn't say anything?? 

2 - I really like some more kinky stuff like choking, slapping, hair pulling, etc etc, but he seems to be pretty vanilla on bed. The sex is good but I really miss something more rough. Would you recommend me asking him during sex (like ""pull my hair"" or ""choke me"") or maybe addressing it another moment?

In order to get it to lay back in its usual hairstyle, i have to full on wash my head with soap and hot water, dry off, and then comb it.

is there a faster/easier way to fix it? Its not really a huge deal for most mornings, I just bend over the tub or sink, or worst case scenario i'll just hop in and take a full on second shower. But it does become a problem during the warmer months when im also attempting to fix helmet hair. Or when i get that dent in it from wearing headphones all day.

But i've spent these last 6 years basically being inside, i never really went out or did anything and now that im better i wanna do a lot of things, one of them is going on a date. But i am completely petrified of doing it because im afraid of being judged.

I'm 22 years old, never kissed a girl, been on a date or lived any kind of normal life because i spent all this time just battling OCD, im afraid of someone thinking its weird, i just wanted to ask any woman my age or even older from past experience, would you date someone in a situation like this? Is it weird would you be creeped out?

This has just been making me really depressed but i don't know if its my mind over-analyzing it when its not the case. I have no fear of social interaction, im just afraid of being looked at as some kind of freak...

After awhile I started crushing on her and normally I'd just ask her out but she was gay and I fucked up explaining to her I'm bi not gay but she thought it was cool to have a gay none attracted to her Freind,( this is a small conservative town 2000&gt; people) and her other two freinds were attracted to her, I'm head over heels for her and I  think she has it for me too, she is prone to touching me, we hangout everyday we play around sexylly (me fake hitting her and she saying harder daddy) she talks about hateing being gay, and regreting not asking people out, she opens up to me, is polite to me (more than others) and doesn't care if I touch her kitty or nipps when we wresle, she is comfy with me holding her little sister, (rare) and more but that is the most important. But she very clearly likes women she has dry fucked her ex when she dating in front of me IDK what that means. She has had gfs, she liked girls but does she like men. When I ask her I she likes me she says thats how she treats her friends (not 100% on that) I love her for more than her looks and Wana make a move but I might lose my only Freind if she says no. IDK if I wouldn't kill myself (prescibed depressed not e boy depressed) I have little I'm in poverty in a town that hates me for fake Bs rumours so she is all I got. Aka If y'all fuck up I might die.

3945,Are men willing to commit to a serious relationship while being a student in university?,"Me, female / mid 20s. 

I'm trying to figure out if it's something that's possible or if people are generally closed off to the idea. I yearn for a sincere relationship where you grow with your partner. I want to have a good time, learn together, build each other up, explore, laugh, cuddle, resolve differences with quality communication, bond intimately, etc. I dont want it to be superficial and temporary, I want to make an investment. I'm tired of witnessing the general population (in my age group) lack desire to be monogamous and committed. I mean, to each their own, I dont judge. It's just extremely hard finding someone who shares my desires of the real thing. Seems like most people just want to focus on themselves and not go out of their way to make things work. I'm aware I'm generalizing, this is just my anecdotal experience. 

Speaking for yourself, would you be willing to commit to someone and make it work even if it's logistically difficult? 

E.g. I'm from LA and will be in SD for 2 years and unsure where I'll end up after. If I'm in a genuine relationship, I would be willing to make it work and compromise where my partner and I lived. Is that not the common consensus? Do people just want to study with their heads down and/or have casual flings and date when they're more settled? If you find something worth fighting for, would you choose not to?

I maintain excellent grades and am able to commit without dragging anyone down, including myself. Do people fear a relationship would jeopardize their education?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ersfgf/are_men_willing_to_commit_to_a_serious/,1579599993

3951,How do I deal with my first big heartbreak?,"I've been talking to this girl for about 4 months, we pretty much clicked instantly and got to know each other really well and honestly I think I fell in love. On New Years I asked her out and she said yes, we continued to date and it was kind of long distance (she lived about 2 hours away from I did, but that didn't stop me from seeing her as much as possible) which made things a little difficult at times. I even changed my mind about which university I wanted to go to just so that I could be closer to her. Unfortunately she's recently had a hard time adjusting to her life as we've both just finished High School and are getting ready to pursue a career or continue studying at a university. 
This hardship has pushed her to the point of breaking up with me, despite all that I've said to ease her and attempt to look for a different solution she's decided it's best that she stays single for now. I understand it may be what she needs and I don't wish her any hardship because I can see the problem from her side of the coin as well as my own. What I don't understand is why I feel so bad, like I've been pushed around and fucked over. I really liked this girl, and it wasn't like any of my previous relationships, this girl was special. Unfortunately she's a bit stubborn like me so she won't be getting back together with me until she stitches her life back together.
She's stated that I haven't lost her and that she wishes to try again when all is well. As much as I like her I'm not too sure about this idea, I feel like if we got back together in say 6 months it would be awkward and it wouldn't work as well as it has this first time.

Men of reddit, what do I do? I'm now stuck in a university I only chose because of her, I can't stop thinking about her and breaking down and I'm not sure about getting back together after a break, despite my feelings for her.

And my issue is this, some people in this sub ask for advice and all. That's great and all. But then I found some thread with the title ""The common lies in this sub"". I agreed with some comments like when some dude say I have big dick or how many woman he gets. But what pisses me off is they categorized as lies the advice that some people gave to them. Like realtionship advice and advice on life, they just shit on that. Like saying ""relationship is like a straight line, but it's damn hard"", or saying ""those dudes who give advice like they have it figured it out"".

That kinda stuff is grinding my gears, some people want to give a helping hand, tried their best to help other but some are just whiny little shit who just keep complaining. 

Another one I found on another sub with this quesion""What is the point of life when you're not rich"". Many other people tried their best to help this dude. Because he may had some issues, but guess what he just kept saying that their advice was shit and all. You may have a bad day, but that stuff is messed up. People want to genuinely help but nope, this dude just want to complain about life. WHy in the first place did you put this question? It's so stupid and assholish to just begin a thread and just shitting on people advice. 

Life is not supposed to be easy, it's not damn fair, but you have to work hard to own it. I was the kinda who kept complaining like those dudes. But then I stopped complaining, worked hard and it was painful but in the end it was wort it. The stuff like get your shit together, egt over yourself can grind your gears but it's a fact that it will help you. 

Anyway I know that I will always see other tread with people complaining. I will always try to help but sometimes I understand why some people say 'just leave the depress people alone"".

However, I can't help how I look or how my body looks. I have tan skin, black hair, and a pretty curvy figure. This has made guys refer to me as Mia Khalifa since 9th grade. As someone who is devoted to being modest, this reality made me really depressed in the past

I even changed schools, attending three different high schools but this harassment and nickname continued to follow me. I now attend college and still get harassed. I always attract the wrong attention and the wrong guys no matter how modestly I dress.

I tried cutting my hair and getting contact lenses to change my look but it has done nothing. Girls sometimes spread rumors about me just because of my shape also. 

I get cat called and have been in rather dangerous situations with guys following me home or crowding me. How can I get guys to stop harassing me? Why am I always such an easy target?

3987,I‚Äôve been blocked by my ex-girlfriend for about a week now. Should I stop wasting my time? She may be manipulative.,"I (24M) met her (23) during college (through Tinder). She started her graduate studies in Neuroscience for a PhD, and I was finishing up my undergraduate studies for computer science (just graduated). The first time I met her, we were getting to know each other and it was a blast: we had so much in common, she was intelligent, funny, and beautiful. About a week in, we started hooking up. And a week later, she asked me if I am her boyfriend, and I said yes. But there were multiple major red flags diving deep into the relationship.


Red flags: she told me that she had been contacting her long term ex-boyfriend as a friend and seemingly hasn‚Äôt moved on from him (he‚Äôs about 300 miles away from our college town), she always hides her phone screen from me whenever I‚Äôm near her presence, and one of my friends found her Tinder profile still up 7 weeks into dating her..

So by the time it was almost finals and the semester was about to end, the day before her birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to tag her in a ‚ÄúIn a Relationship‚Äù status just to surprise her. I mean, 8 weeks into dating and we were working on something together, so I felt it was the right time. This backfired, and she told me that she likes to keep her private life ‚Äúprivate‚Äù. She then had to explain to her friends, family, Mom, and ex about me. I apologized and tried to explain that it was a mistake, but she replied by blocking me on Facebook (probably to hide any ties with her)

I thought this was odd. A week after this conundrum, we spent some time together in her apartment, and while we were getting ready for bed, she asked me to give her her phone downstairs. I thought to myself that this was the moment I get to know the truth. I started snooping (unacceptable, but necessary) her messages and I found a text message from a guy who asked if she‚Äôs down for dinner while we were dating. She didn‚Äôt respond to him (or she probably deleted her responses), but I confronted her about it. She then said to me ‚Äúif you think I‚Äôm cheating on you, you should leave‚Äù. She then broke down, and I said it‚Äôs okay, trying to calm her down since she was having panic attacks

The next early morning while she was sleeping, things didn‚Äôt add up to me, so I managed to snoop her phone again. This time, I found out she‚Äôs been in contact with multiple guys in the area through text (comprising of when she‚Äôs available in the evenings) and her matching on Tinder (no flirtatious messages). But the worst of it all, her text message to her ex boyfriend made my heart palpitate. She explained to him that the ‚ÄúIn a Relationship‚Äù status was fake, claiming that I ‚Äúwas a graduate student who wanted her attention and stalk her or something‚Äù. Then her ex suggested to talk shit about me if she had any mutual friends

I confronted her about it, she threatened to call the police on me but she cried and tried to explain her innocence , and I naively forgave her.

So the next day, I sent her an essay of wanting to break up with her going along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm breaking up with you. You‚Äôre cheating on me, and I want my things back‚Äù
She said in reply ‚ÄúThank you for all the bullshit assumptions and for saying I love you about an hour ago, was that just to play with my emotions? Nice to know literally everything wanting to be with me meant nothing. Goodbye, OP‚Äù
She then explained to me that she uses Tinder because she‚Äôs conceited and prideful, that she uses for attention.
I then, out of misery, said that I still love her. And she replied back with ‚ÄúAnd I still love you‚Äù

We then agreed to keep each other as ‚Äúfriends for now‚Äù the following day because we obviously have strong feelings for each other. 

So after graduation and during Christmas break, I burned a lot of bridges and crossed boundaries from our ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. I sent her an essay demanding for reciprocal love during her time in work, instead of calling her I showed up unexpectedly to her apartment to ask if she‚Äôs moving on (and to get my things back), and my phone call conversations always consisted of me asking her if she still loves me and everything. Then I accused her that ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve moved on‚Äù after I found her Tinder profile 8 days ago. She said in reply that my accusations are narrative, that I am putting her on edge all of the time, and that she dearly loved me. And this caused her to block me partially everywhere. After realizing I‚Äôve been blocked on my phone, I frantically started freaking out and was delirious. I managed to contact her via email, asking for a way to elaborate and clarify that I still trust her. She then sent me the following email:  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I literally don‚Äôt know what else to do. I‚Äôm just sitting here crying and I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I feel like you keep me on edge all of the time because I never know what you might do or say. You take narratives and run with them. I start my classes tomorrow morning and I don‚Äôt think it would be helpful if we talked right now, but I also don‚Äôt think it would be helpful in general if we were talking at all for¬†the time being. Please understand. I‚Äôm so sorry, I don‚Äôt know how to handle this. I think you are an awesome, amazing person and I would like to talk again, but stuff like this keeps happening and it‚Äôs not okay. This hurts me so much, and I know it must hurt you too, but I think it's for the best. You will always be in my heart. Please take care of yourself and be safe. Don't isolate yourself. Talk with your friends and relatives. I'm going to get better too and everything will be okay. Maybe in the future we can talk again, I don't know, but I do know that I need to be okay first.‚Äù

I then replied her that I‚Äôll respect her well-being, that I agree that this is probably the best for both of us, and that I dearly loved her and I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôve been a shitty guy. 

Shen then told me ‚ÄúI appreciate that. Also, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a shitty guy so please don‚Äôt beat yourself up over anything. Thank you for understanding.‚Äù

I'm (21f) in a long distance relationship of two years with my boyfriend (22), lately he has been odd, not distance but not super lovey dovey which is fine. But after nagging him to look at his syllabus which he just got about six days ago to see when he can come see me he finally did. He was suppose to come see me this coming month but claims he is too busy and it will have to be March. I just suggest that I can come see him then. He then said he didn't want to do that because he would have almost no time to spend with me and if we are going to spend all that money and time and effort then he wants it to be when he can actually spend time with me. I don't care, just seeing him and being next to him is good enough for me, at least at night I'll be able to hold him and be close to him. I understand this is a busy semester for him, but he can almost never answer my calls and I'm always waiting for him to call. Again I'm fine with that but what makes me upset is that he doesn't say anything that sweet or sincere or does anything to make me feel loved. I try to communicate how I feel and ask him to just be affectionate and he says okay but nothing really changes. He almost seems like he isn't as in love with me as he use to.  I understand he is busy but something feels off. I know he doesn't want to break up, I actually almost broke up with him because it was so bad I didn't think he was as interested as he use to be. I use to get ""you're so pretty"" or ""you make me happy' or just sweet little things that like that even when he is busy  But now nothing.

When I asked her out, we were only the same team.  But recently, I was promoted and became her manager.  She doesn't seem too happy about it.  I am not interested in her anymore but I still try to be friendly.  I try to say good morning and good-bye.  I tried to make chit chat but she's giving me the cold shoulder every time.  I am not saying she has to be my friend but her attitude is causing the work environment to be very awkward and unpleasant to work in.  It's easy to say just keep things professional and only focus on work related tasks but it's not that simple.  I feel her motivation will drop because of this environment and why have such a tense work environment when it doesn't seem to benefit anyone?  I tried having a 1-on-1 meeting with her, just to know her better and get to know more about her work and her goals just like any good manager would, but she only gave one word answer.

Is there anything I can do at this point?  I thought about just having a frank 1-on-1 discussion about the awkwardness but I feel she's going to deny any wrongdoing on her part.

Both never cheated, no major fights, passion didnt die, nothing. we were SO not perfect of course, and each had our bad days, but in all honestly, we were so equal and really connected on a deep level.  

No issues, no signs, no lack of intimacy, nothing. he woke up after an amazing night out, and said he wants to be alone. He said he envisions his life alone.  I am so broken- i wrote him a letter, then we saw each other 2 weeks later. I asked what happened, what did i do, what made him lose interest, and he said it has nothing to do with me, and that he genuinely wants to be alone and doesn‚Äôt want to be with anyone. wants to be alone more than he loves me.  (he doesnt have social media, he isn‚Äôt a go to a bar n screw kinda guy (nothing against those guys!) he has always kept to himself and does his own thing. (if hes bangin 10 ppl right now, more power to him lol)  

his ACTIONS spoke so much louder than his words- he showed me nothing but love, he was asking me what trip i wanted to go on, what color to paint his bathroom, and getting me stuff for his house that i liked. Days before. Never once did I feel not secure, in 5 years.  again, we were not perfect, but it was so healthy and equal. 

We havent spoke in 2 months. I love him more than anything and am trying my best to respect his space, not reach out or anything.  I dont know what to do or think. There are of course 100 other variables to this, but I am being honest when i say there is nothing that stands out to me, and he is just like ‚Äúi just want to be alone now‚Äù.

4061,How should you help your best friend with heartbreak,"For context, one of my best friends is a poor starving artist who's trying to make it in life. We decided that we would open up a company together. He has pretty low self-esteem as his family has never treated him right and always treated him like a failure for being a poor starving artist. He never really had the greatest grades in school and has been pretty down on his luck his whole life and it doesn't help that we've known each other for most of our lives and I've always been relatively successful in most of my endeavors like school and stuff and so he has always had his family compare him to me (which was not my intention at all. I just have a strict family, so I had to do well), but he's a genuinely nice guy and has helped me out many times.

So my best friend fell in love with a girl, but the girl decided to end their relationship after kinda playing around with his heart. He's been pretty devastated and has been down on his luck this whole time. He talked to me about his self-worth and how he felt himself growing older and not having much success in life and how he has always felt like a failure and how the girl playing with him made him feel worthless as though there was nothing good nor talented about him. It's an odd thing; even if he's my best friend and not family, his pain felt as if it were my pain, almost as though the girl had played with me instead of him. I didn't know exactly how to help with it, so I told him what I personally thought about relationships myself. I personally believe that relationships are there to test compatibility and that it's better to test them sooner rather than later, however I felt that it was a crummy - perhaps too logical answer, and don't believe I helped cheer him up. So I I said that I would be there for him and that if he needed me I would talk. I'm not sure what else I can do about it but it's painful seeing him so down when I know he's got immense talent within himself even if no one else thinks he does.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eroa62/how_should_you_help_your_best_friend_with/,1579574935

4063,Bf broke up but wants to be friends?,"
When we broke up he said he didn‚Äôt want to end on a bad note and that he still wants me in his life, just as a friend. He briefly offered we could just take a break but I was just like if you want to break up than we‚Äôll break up and he didn‚Äôt press it further
He said the reason he wanted to break up was I flirted with a guy several months ago and while he‚Äôs been trying to trust me it‚Äôs been really hard (especially since I‚Äôm in the military so I‚Äôm away from him surrounded by a bunch of guys several days a month)
Any thoughts on this?
I read a psychology article awhile back that said if exes are friends after a breakup they‚Äôre either still in love or never were... and I was definitely in love with him and he was always good to me...

We still text each other asking how each other‚Äôs days were and if we‚Äôre okay etc etc but I don‚Äôt want to stay friends with him if he‚Äôs just keeping me in his life as a type of side chick even though he‚Äôs not that kind of guy...

4064,Does he like me or am i overreacting?,"I bumped into this guy who i went to hs with at the airport. We‚Äôll call him Drew. We never really talked before but we did have mutual friends. Anyway, we both had some small talk and found out that we were both heading to Hawaii on the same flight. During this time I was pregnant and meeting my boyfriend in Hawaii while Drew was meeting up with his parents. Not only were we on the same flight but we were actually seated together! At the time, I was annoyed cause I‚Äôm pregnant and I was hoping to catch some sleep. We ended up talking the whole flight (5 hours). I kept the conversation going because I hate awkward silence. Anyway, people around us would congratulate us thinking that we were a couple but before i could correct them, he went along with it by thanking people. I thought it was innocent jokes so i didnt care. 

After the flight, he texted me saying that he still couldn‚Äôt believe that we were seated next to each other and claimed it was ‚Äúfate‚Äù. 

A month later I find out that we were both taking the same online college course. I had just given birth so I have a family. Over the course of the semester he texted me everyday talking about his family, what he was doing, and even about his bio mom abandoning him. Our conversations would go on the whole day until 2am. Im up at this time of course cause I have a newborn. I just thought he needed a friend to rant to. Didn‚Äôt think too much of it. 

He would ask for pictures of my daughter saying that shes so cute and getting so big and that he couldn‚Äôt wait to meet her. 

One day he called me huffing and puffing about how this guy he was supposed to get tattooed from flaked on his appointment. Drew wanted to go to this guys house and fight or whatever. I tried to calm him down. He txted me after thanking me. 

It was friendly up until the point where he sent me pictures of his new tattoo on his chest and his neck. I talked to my bf about it and he thinks that drew likes me.  

If that‚Äôs the case, I want to set boundaries but in a polite way!

I usually stuck to exclusively body weight exercises but since my parents started supporting me getting into better shape, I‚Äôve been expanding on the range of what I try and do. 

My mother, who has never even been in a gym and is overweight, suggested picking up some weights at a local place. 

So I got a pair of 5LBs and a pair of 10LBs. 

Then my dad (who worked out twice a week over 20 years ago) told me that at 18 I should be lifting atleast 40-50 LB and working towards a minimum of 70LB. Per arm. 

To be honest, I‚Äôm actually stronger than I expected myself to be and 10LB is feeling not light but I can barely notice the weight and it takes very little to no effort to do anything with them.

4076,How does a guy struggling with his finances explains his situation to a new date?,"I have been lurking for a while and this is something that I keep thinking about when it comes to start a new relationship.  I'm a middle aged man, never married but with a young kid from a previous relationship; I have a good job and I'm working hard to try to get a promotion and improve my professional prospect, but due to very questionable financial decision in the past I am barely surviving.

I'm working really hard to get my finances in order and I'm proud of the fact that I paid of one loan and will take care of two (or possibly three) this year; things are looking up but besides the times I spend with my kid I'm mostly alone because I think I can't afford dating.

My last girlfriend and I broke up because we couldn't talk about money; we were both middle aged parents with young kids, but she thought I was ""cheap"" even though I paid for most of our dates.  We enjoyed our time together and got along well with each other kids, but we were both  struggling financially and had diametrically opposite approach to money management.

After that experience I put even more urgency on getting a good grip on my finances; I cut my expenses even more, cut my 401k contributions to the minimum... but mostly spend my free time at home watching TV or reading.   That was depressing (and I struggled with depression for a long time when I was younger) so I updated my dating profile and starting swiping left and right.

Well, a couple of weeks ago a very attractive middle aged divorcee liked what she saw and contacted me; we had a nice conversation and ended up exchanging numbers.  I called her yesterday and agree on going on a date on Friday and I really need your advice on how to approach this situation if we get serious.

I know I shouldn't left past experiences mess up new ones and I know that if a woman tells me that I'm cheap for whatever reason that's a red flag that can't be ignored.   Also important to mention because I think is relevant is that I'm an immigrant to the USA and in my culture the man always pays for everything and even though I'm very assimilated I feel really ashamed to let a lady pay for half the bill when we go out....which is silly, because even my last ex actually paid for some dates herself.

I feel like I'm rambling and I don't even know if I have good long term prospect with this lady, but for the future: how should I go about regarding my finances and dating?

4078,How to proceed with gym crush,"We‚Äôve been going to the same gym for quite a while, but I‚Äôve only noticed in the last couple of months that he‚Äôd stare at me. At first, I thought this was maybe by chance, but then it happened too often so I figured there was more to it.  I did one of those smile nod things to him a few times and he‚Äôd keep staring. So naturally, I started paying more attention. He would often look over at me from afar and glance over. If I looked back, he‚Äôd look away and that happens quite a bit. When we walk passed each other, he wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact. Then, in the last week, I noticed he‚Äôd actually put his head down when he‚Äôd see me approaching from afar, and turn his head away. I asked him last week if he was using these weights by him, and when he saw me approach, he put his head down and just nodded no without speaking or looking up.  I also feel like he‚Äôs on nearby machines often or just generally in the same area, but that could also be coincidence. 

I went back and forth on whether I should even say hi.  It seemed like I made him slightly uncomfortable if he can‚Äôt make eye contact. Plus, I certainly don‚Äôt feel/look that attractive in the gym. Then today, he was getting spotted by my friend so I thought in the least this could make for good conversation.  He was at the machine next to me at the end of my workout, so I finally got the courage to introduce myself. He was super nice and actually not really shy at all.  We talked about our workout for the day and where we‚Äôre from in the area and so forth. He even said he noticed how much I can lift and called me strong (which in the least makes me think he wants me to know he‚Äôs looked over?).  I said I hope it wasn‚Äôt weird that I came up to him and he said he was glad I did and it wasn‚Äôt since we see each other practically every weekday. We talked for like 5 minutes and he was actually the one who kept trying to talk more. We shook hands and said we‚Äôd see each other tomorrow. 

So I‚Äôm just really bad at reading signs, but it kind of seems like he may be interested as well? I want to see how the conversation goes for this week and if we actually do more than just wave, then maybe I‚Äôd ask him by the end of the week if he wants to grab a coffee sometime. Should I wait longer than that? Should I try to gauge how interested he actually is/isn‚Äôt since we just spoke for the first time? TIA!

Anyway, we continued chatting on tinder and I casually asked her to go out a few times and she avoided the question twice and said ""probably not tonight"" the next...I was specifically asking her to hang out a week in advance. Around mid December I was getting very frustrated putting effort into meeting this girl because it felt like she kept casually avoiding my question to hang. Her being the only girl I was chatting with on tinder I messaged her and said ""hey I need to take a break from tinder"". She said ""no worries"" and added me on Facebook a week later and pmd me and said ""tinder is dumb lol"". I've casually kept in touch trying to get her to hang still but she's still avoiding it. I really have no idea why I have a big crush on this girl but I do. I feel like she wouldn't of added me if she wasn't interested but who knows...I haven't deleted her but I unfollowed her of IG and FB because when I see her face I get sad and stuff :( I know this sounds lame but I feel like she secretly enjoys making me suffer.

We went on one date, and he said he wanted to do it again. We've been talking every night since. He's a bit awkward though. He was homeschooled, never had a GF and I'm pretty sure he's a virgin. I'm not. But I don't mind any of that. 

I can't guage if he's too awkward/ oblivious to my advances. I've been lightly flirting with him. But I don't really get anything back. So I don't know if he's not into it. Or, if he's just inexperienced with flirting. He said that he's bad and flirting and often can't tell.

So I guess, what do I do now? Do I come on stronger and maybe make a fool of myself? Or back off and stay as friends (which I'm also happy to do, he's a cool guy, I don't mind either way).

So two weeks ago our basement flooded, luckily the basement is unfinished and nothing of value was damage. Now my main concern was once I cleaned up the water, the flood had white fluffy mold growing as the floor was drying. I had a fan and a dehumidifier running the whole time yet mold still formed. This last weekend I ripped up the large area rug that was now garbage and tried to mop the floor with cleaner thinking that would get rid of the mold.... nope. Once the mop water started to dry new mold started forming, same white fluffy stuff as before. Now my main concern is my pregnant girlfriend (she doesn't go in the basement) and my cats as their litter box is in the basement. How can I clean the cement floor without mold growing? I'm in Canada and opening basement windows is not an option to help air out the basement.

My (24F) boyfriend (23M) and I have been together for a little over two years now and I feel like I am the cause for our lack of passion. After recovering from a very traumatic and abusive divorce on my side, we met one another soon after while I was admittedly still healing. I have a son from my previous marriage and we are currently expecting another seedling together. He has completely and wholeheartedly put himself into and accepted the role of being my sons father (birth father is not involved whatsoever), and he is over the moon excited for our little one brewing. I started going to therapy after my marriage concluded and was eventually diagnosed with depression and anxiety. He was there (in my life) for my diagnosis, me first getting on meds, and me being medicated. He has stuck through it all and has endured me and all my baggage. My issue is this-I was a bitch. I was and am still learning to deal with jealousy, anxiety, insecurity, depression, PTSD, and now that I am pregnant, I‚Äôve had to halt all my previously prescribed meds. I feel like all of this has caused him to harden to me a little and become less...in love with me. I know he loves me and our family, but I just feel like I don‚Äôt make his eyes glimmer like I used to, and I do not want to lose him. I am realizing the fault in my ways and I want to be better. I still go to therapy and am still healing. We still have sex regularly, maybe 2-3 times a week, definitely not as much as we used to, but I want the connection we used to share. I get glimmers every once in a while but it doesn‚Äôt last. What are some ways that I can whoo him again? Or remind him why we fell in love? Maybe little steps I can take towards growth?

So we were renting hotels for a weekend vacation in Seaside NJ, a beach town where you go to party and drink on the boardwalk and stuff. I had my own room because I was single. My friend's gf texts me saying ""Good news! My friend R thinks you're cute. She  wants wants to come with us and stay in your room."" My friend texted me on the side telling me she basically was said without saying that she wanted to fuck. I'm ecstatic at this point. I tell her send the pic. Gentlemen, only way I could have been less interested is if she were a dude. So I'm thinking how do I get out of this, since I'll inevitably meet this girl. It must have been a half hr of me deliberating. My friend is texting me like ""Yo my gf and her friend are waiting. What's up?"" So eventually I texted something like ""Thanks but I'm fine.""                                     It gets better. A week later, that same friend's gf throws a small watch party for Mayweather McGregor I (cuz we know II is inevitable.) I walk in, and sitting at the table is R who I rejected, and a new girl, A. A is gorgeous and I'm instantly infatuated. I start chatting her up immediately. Finally I ask my friend's gf ""Yo, what's up with A? She single?"" Turns out she's the best friend of R, who I basically rejected on sight.

4298,My life-long best friend wants to date me.,"I‚Äôve known my best friend since we were kids, we grew up together, then he moved away but visited every summer vacation. He was the first guy I kissed and dated. First time in 7th grade, it went wrong (he liked a friend of mine and kinda dumped me), then in 10th grade (same thing + he was having drug issues and was all over the place and screamed at me and locked me up in a room).

I stopped talking to him after the 2nd dating attempt, he got sober and 2 years later apologised for being such an asshole until I forgave him and we became friends again.

Then once a year or so he asked for another chance to be with me. I always said ‚Äúno‚Äù because I never wanted to get hurt again + he was always judgemental of who I was dating and was always asking for a new chance only after his relationships were failing. He had this romantic idea that we should be together bc we knew each other since we were in diapers. But it felt like a desperate last resort option. I never felt like a priority.

That happened for years until I introduced him to a colleague of mine, 4-5 years ago, and he basically married her after a couple of months of dating. I made up some excuse and did not go to the wedding - I couldnt believe he was so nice with her and with me he never had been, despite me always being there for him. He got upset and we didnt talk for a year, but then we reconnected again and were best friends again. I even visited him and his wife and I was happy for him. He was an emotional wreck before her, had alcohol problems and then he became like the best version of himself. So I understood her personality brought out the best in him and I was trully happy for him.

He was sometimes rubbing it in my face that he could have married me instead, but apart from this, it all seemed awesome until they had a baby and he told me he was cheating on his wife. He said they were not having sex and this was an arrangement they had made.

At the same time, we spent an evening together watching a movie and all of a sudden I started feeling things for him, which totally freaked me out because I had never had any romantic feelings for years for him.  Plus I was seeing someone else. I basically ran away from his flat in the middle of the night. I told him about my feelings and we decided to just move on.

At the baptism of his kid he was super strange - totally ignored me. We still hanged out whenever he visited (we live in different places).Then he called me to wish me a happy NY - which he never does and told me he got a divorce. I was shocked, he seemed so happy with his wife, only mentioned she is bad with money, but nothing more. 

We hanged out and stayed up late drinking and talking. He told me everything about the marriage. And then - AGAIN, hinted at us being together. Told me he doesnt feel as close as he is to me with nobody else and that he had been separated from his wife, but they had kept it private since she was pregnant (so the night we watched the movie and got close he was not with her anymore).

It got me thinking. Should I give this a chance if we happen to both be single at the same time? I am physically atttracted to him, I love him a lot, what happened happened in our teens, now we are in our thirties. But I still have this feeling that he wants more the idea of me and a romantic dream than who I am. And that no matter how convincing he may sound, I should stay the fuck away. All his relationships ended within 4 years time. They all started and ended the same. And he never wanted to go to therapy or do some soul searching.  Just partied until the next one, then got sober again and so on.Now he is still seeing the girl he cheated on with because she totally adores him and he hates being alone. Which I kinda get but I dont know... it feels selfish. And I dont like the way he treats her. Most of the time he is nice to her, but he sometimes treated her like a servant. Or like she is stupid... not ok. She is also much younger than us.

4317,How much does your mindset affect your view of yourself?,"Before I start, I'll preface this by saying I understand that it could be considered vein to care about one's appearance, and that I should just 'get over it' or 'stop giving a \*\*\*'. I'm just looking for some input from other men who may have gone through something similar.

**Onto my post...**

Over the past year, I have made inconsistent but effective changes in my life to try and address certain faults within myself. I have made significant progress when looking back at how I was this time last year. 

I've completely overcome a habitual addiction that had been destroying me for the last 2 years. I've grown socially and emotionally, and I've been working on my self image and how I present myself.

I still have a long way to go, but i'm making progress, slowly but surely.

One of the things I seem to be stuck on is my physical appearance. I've been told i'm good looking and had interest from women. But I can't accept it. I have major insecurities with my looks, and they have always affected my confidence. So much that until last year, when i turned 21, I never let myself entertain the idea of having a romantic partner, Instead I convinced myself that I actually didn't desire any romantic relationships. (when in reality, I was just trying to suppress my worries that I'm not good enough to have one).

**Now onto the main point of my post...**

I noticed that some days, when I look in a mirror, I think I look hideous, and my mood is then affected for the rest of the day. But I noticed that when I'm having a good day, have taken care of myself and my responsibilities, when I look at myself, I see myself as a decently attractive guy. My smile looks better, eyes look more lively, hair seems nicer, my figure even looks improved.

Does having a negative mindset really reflect how you see yourself to that extent? Could most of my worries and insecurities be fed by my negativity and self loathing, which in turn actually makes things seem worse than they really are?

I'm just trying to understand how my opinion of myself can vary so much, all depending on what my current mindset is.

If anyone has any similar experiences, or reading material that could help me understand this situation, I'd really appreciate it. Feels like I'm a bit stuck trying to figure this out.

I've lost 20 lbs to get down to 185 lbs so I'm feeling and looking better.  At the same time, my wife had knee surgery and put on a few lbs from lack of mobility.  She is on no restrictions and refuses to do any PT because she is a nurse and knows what's best.  The truth is that she is incredibly lazy and very sensitive about her appearance.  I've been trying to make subtle comments and even listing out the local gyms that our insurance accepts but nothing has helped.  I tried this one to no effect.   ""You won the genetic lottery.  You look good without having to live in the gym.  Imagine how much better you would look and feel if with diet and exercise"".  She didn't like that.  She is also constantly telling me how to eat and exercise but is convinced that fad diets and shakes are the way to do it.

I expressed that I didn‚Äôt want to go in this weather and why it felt rude of him to ask me to do that. He said he understood and then said ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I plan something next time so it doesn‚Äôt inconvenience you?‚Äù I declined because the first impression was a bit too much and it didn‚Äôt feel like he was apologetic or even realized he was asking too much.

4345,Can you really be platonic friends with someone you slept with and is it ok to hang out with them when you now are with someone else?,"So, I‚Äôve known my boyfriend since August 2018, we‚Äôve dated a few times in the past but this time it‚Äôs not casual and we‚Äôve been together for 3 months. When we first met we‚Äôd both just gotten out of serious relationships where we‚Äôd had our hearts broken. 

He met F around September 2018 and they had a short casual fling and remained friends. I was a little jealous of her (never met her and personally don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs attractive but he obviously did). So they‚Äôve not been in a relationship and they haven‚Äôt (as far as I‚Äôm aware) had a sexual encounter for over a year. In that time we dated for a few months but it wasn‚Äôt good timing as we both were still messed up from the serious relationships, and then he dated someone else entirely for four months. So I knew he was still friends with F and didn‚Äôt care much until we started dating again towards the end of last year. We got back together because it was a better time for us both and the feelings never faded. 

We told each other we love each other, a big deal for us both having only said it in serious relationships before. I brought up F for some reason and he told me he wishes they never had a sexual relationship because they‚Äôre really good friends and she helped him through his break up and he values her friendship. Fine, not ideal as I have no experience with guys having female friends they‚Äôve got a history with, but I have to accept it. 

Anyway, I have a history of overthinking and he knows this. He‚Äôs always been completely honest about something if I ask him a question, which i really appreciate but I found out from a Facebook post that she tagged him in that he‚Äôd been at hers in the last few months. I asked him about it calmly and he said ‚Äòyeah, I was there around November I think?‚Äô And I asked why he hadn‚Äôt told me before or if he lied about it and he said ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt lie, I just didn‚Äôt mention it. It didn‚Äôt come up, I don‚Äôt tell you every time I hang out with the boys and I didn‚Äôt want you to over think‚Äô but that‚Äôs really upset me. He said he realises he should have told me (in fairness i think it was before we told each other how we felt and before things became more serious where were now talking about a future together) and that in future he will mention it just so I feel included and know that he‚Äôs not being shady or hiding anything. 

I genuinely believe from his point of view that there‚Äôs no feelings there, if there was then he‚Äôs had the past year to start things up again. However, he told me that she‚Äôs made it clear she‚Äôs interested in him by asking if we‚Äôre still together and when he said yes she‚Äôs responded by saying ‚Äòdamn‚Äô (this, as far as I know, was after they last hung out, I think she said this recently). 

I mean, in general guys is normal to hang out with a girl you‚Äôve slept with but have no feelings or attraction to, one on one? They hung out at her house and had a takeaway and watched a film. I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around this and don‚Äôt want to be naive but at the same time I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend who‚Äôs had female friends he actually hangs out with like that, and I don‚Äôt have guy friends that I hang out with alone regularly if that makes sense. 

I don‚Äôt want to make him feel like he can‚Äôt be her friend, I don‚Äôt want to be controlling or anything. But I‚Äôm uncomfortable with them having out again knowing now that she still likes him and quite frankly, I just don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt see why they would need to meet up and hang out and do what we do minus the sex when he has me?

Can you help me to understand a different perspective please? 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend is friends with someone he had a casual sexual fling with over a year ago and they sometimes hang out alone. He assures me they‚Äôre just strictly friends (from his side) but I still feel super uncomfortable with it and don‚Äôt know what I should do.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ercy25/can_you_really_be_platonic_friends_with_someone/,1579525463

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any tips on becoming more masculine? 
I‚Äôve constantly been mistaken for gay my entire teenage life. I‚Äôm almost 19 and have never had a girlfriend. 
I‚Äôm not sure what it is about me that makes me seem gay, I guess I subconsciously act in a feminine way. I think I may make quick movements while interacting with people. For example, if I were sitting down somewhere and someone come up next to me and said hello, I would quickly turn my neck to them subconsciously. Is stuff like that a feminine trait? 
I don‚Äôt have a gay voice, I‚Äôve always been told it‚Äôs deep. I think a contributing factor to my femininity is the fact that I was raised by women primarily, my mother and my grandmother. My father died when I was very young, and thus I didn‚Äôt grow up with much of a masculine role model.

4381,"""Better to have loved and lost than to not love at all"".","It's been probably 6 or 7 years since I've seen this girl in person but to be frank she's always been on my mind in one way or another. We used to text each other all the time and even hangout by ourselves occasionally but I was always too afraid to make a move. I always wonder if it was due to my insecurity and feeling she was completely out of my league but what kills me inside to most is that the more I think about it, the more I think what wasted opportunity I had.

I was into her the minute I met her and even through my insecurity I managed to get her number, visited her house and she visiting mine. We would even talk about sex and fantasize about being together however we would both always chalk it up to joking around. But even through all that I let her slip through the cracks, without even a kiss. I feel I'm the direct example of the Shakespearean adage of ""Better to have loved and lost than to never love at all"", with me obviously being an example of the later.

This Friday I plan on going back and trying for a second time. 

How do you mingle in a bar by yourself if you don't drink alcohol? I've never took a sip of beer, and my parents stopped when they found out they were going to have my older brother.

I‚Äôm 21 and currently living with my parents, fresh out of college. With tons of more time on my hands and single (although my heart does belong to a special someone), I‚Äôve always wanted to be a little more social or outgoing. 

I‚Äôve always been a good kid growing up. No drugs or alcohol, never around the wrong crowd, did his homework and studied and did well in school, but I always seemed to prefer indoors rather than the nightlife or whatever. 

I think I‚Äôve always thought that I‚Äôm a good person, but severely lacking in the social department. Yet, I‚Äôve never really been attracted to partying or clubbing or drinking or anything. Even when I‚Äôve been offered the chance to go to any of these things, I refuse. Some people see this as abnormal due to my age, but I‚Äôm unsure about that. 

To add a little more personal details, I‚Äôve been to a couple of parties, but they‚Äôre not really my thing. I was actually bored, even with a little alcohol in my system. I guess I‚Äôm boring? But I don‚Äôt want to be like that forever, so how can be more outgoing? Or is there something wrong with me for not liking what most people my age like to do?

4478,Pain after long period of arousal without ejaculating?,"Hi,

I'm a 31 yo gay male, and a few months I started dating this guy I'm really into and super attracted by.  

Recently we spent a 7 day vacation together during which we were in each other's presence all day long.   It was also the first time I went on a relatively long vacation with someone I am dating and liking so much.  We would have sex in the morning then go out and have sex at night again and do fun activities during the day.  

The thing is that, in the period between morning and evening sex, I was constantly excited.  Since we had sex around 9 am and then again around 11 pm, I basically had a boner that would go one and off for 13 hrs (say 30 min on, 30 min off). 

The first day this happened it was quite fun.  I was excited to be so excited, but then I started to feel pain at the basis of the penis, at a +/-45 degree angle in the direction of the abdomen.  It would hurt on touch, diminish when seated, and gradually disappear after ejaculation.

Maybe some of you will get a kicker out of this, but is this normal? Is this what people refer to as blue balls?

I'm a bit worried this might be causes by some prostate provlems, so I thought I could consult the wisdom of the collective and see if anyone had experienced the same, or had any either anecdotal or professional knowledge that could help me.

4480,Am I needy for wanting more interaction (texting),"Backstory: I (26F) have been dating a guy (27M) for about 2 months now. It's kinda long distance, we live an hour apart and only see each other on the weekends/every other weekend. He warned me beforehand that he's not a consistent texter/this has been a problem with his exes. He's made it clear that if I get frustrated by it, let him know. But he'll go 12-18 hrs before responding sometimes and I don't feel comfortable telling him every few days that I need more interaction. I know he's on his phone all the time so a quick ""I'm thinking about you"" would suffice. 

At first, he made a huge effort to interact, it think it was the whole ""chase"" phase. But things moved kinda quickly and now it's pretty much implied we're together (met his whole fam, bought me a toothbrush for his place, his mom loves me, etc.). So now he makes much less of an effort and I'm happy if I get 1 or 2 responses a day. 

Anyway, this weekend I've been incredibly ill, even ended up in the hospital for a brief stay. I've barely heard from him. I know he's concerned for me but only because he sent a breiyf text saying so. The thing is, things are 100% different when were together, he's extremely attentive, loving, interested in me, always caressing, introduced me to this whole friend group and coworkers. No doubt he's interested, but I just don't understand why he leaves me unread for hours upon hours. Am I too needy? 

TL;DL dating a guy who lives an hour away and warned me about being a horribly texter. I didn't  1-3 replies/day is generous. He explicitly said to tell him when I get frustrated but I feel like that's be naggy. Recently very ill/brief hospital stay and he only send a few texts to check in on me.

4523,How do you get over a breakup,"So this isn‚Äôt like a terrible breakup where we never want to see each other again or anything. No scandals happened. She sat me down yesterday and she confessed that due to a sexual abusive relationship she was scared of commitment. She had unwantingly broken us up in the past just to say she was wrong, and I, who loves this girl more than anyone else I had met, knew she never wanted to breakup up. I love her and she literally pulled me out of depression. What can I do to come to terms that we‚Äôre no longer together but are still gonna be around each other. How do I cope with these feelings I‚Äôll no longer get to express.

4537,Ex ignored my apology,"Ok, so I DMed an ex of long ago to ask for old band pictures (he was in a band with friends of mine). We made small talk some, and I sent an inappropriate (sexual)message. I was having bad mental health problems at the time and am married. I felt so horrible about this. He said he wasn't interested as he was in a relationahip.  I sent another message apologizing. He ignored it, so I sent another message. He asked me to stop messaging him. I had originally wanted to collaborate on this project with him, and messaged him about it. No answer. I messaged again, no answer. I messaged again, and he said he wasn't interested.

A month later I accidentally messaged him on Insta as his name on my DM list was above a friend's and I accidentally clicked on it. I messaged him and asked him to delete our conversation. No answer. So I messaged directions as he is not too tech savvy. No answer. I finally got annoyed and said that I knew he was ignoring me and probably thought I was a piece of hot garbage but could he please delete our conversation. He wrote back and said he deleted it and that he was blocking me necause I had no understanding of boundaries or personal space.

Around this time I was hospitalized and got a stern lecture from my doctor to start taking the correct dosage of my antidepressant (I had started taking less to save money as I didn't have insurance at the time). Not being on the right dosage made me act irrational, obsessive and inappropriate.

I messaged him with a very long apology. I never respected his wishes and apologized for acting how J did. I explained the antidepressants and the hospitalization. No answer.

4539,I have been getting way too comfortable with myself. How do I change it?,"When I was 20, I was a guy who hated myself - I never liked the way I looked. Was never happy with my lack of skills, etc. Over the course of two years, I've built great confidence and self-esteem. I am great with people, have productive hobbies and doing fairly well at college. I am fortunate to have an amazing girlfriend (of four years) who has helped me a lot with life. As of now, I'm starting to focus a bit on my social life too.
However, I have noticed that since 5-6 months, I've been growing super lazy and comfortable with who I am.
I eat whatever pleases my taste buds. The moment my brain thinks it needs to do something, I enter the Netflix and Video-games realm. Outside college, my productivity is almost zero. I've lost touch with fitness - I can barely climb 2 flights of stairs without running out of breath.
In 5 months, I'll be graduating. I'm scared the real world won't be this easy and I need to get back into a life of more discipline. But my drive... Its missing. Initially, I used to have the need to impress people, but now that's gone. I have developed a 'happy-go-lucky' attitude which I really want to change.
What would your advice be?
P.S. - I am happy to admit that I never got into alcohol or drugs, so that's a part of life I don't fear. However, I'm always attracted to junk food which I know is worse for my health.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/er4nxt/i_have_been_getting_way_too_comfortable_with/,1579478208

The refrigerator didn't even have a lightbulb when I moved in, I bought one, I get paper towels for the kitchen, I get air freshener for the bathroom to my surprise they didn't use them and when I asked one to pick one up she said she didn't want to be spending money that it's $1. I do my dishes immediately after using them, wipe off the table. One of them does not do that. They let dishes build.

4549,How do I stop feeling overwhelmed about everything all the time?,"I'm feeling so anxious at the time of writing this. I just get this feeling of anxiety get overwhelmed and this loneliness feeling a lot. I study in at uni in England, but I'm still home in my country because uni starts in a week from now, so I'm still in my country. That means I haven't properly worked out in over a month. And I really miss actually lifting weights and not just doing push ups in my room or small dumbbell exercises. I'm really insecure about a lot of things. My height, me feeling small, how I appear to others, what first impression do I give to others etc. This Christmas period has been super stressful, I haven't been able to feel Christmas because of all of the assignments that I had. I was studying on Christmas Eve, on New Year's Eve, on New Year's day.. From Web Programming (HTML CSS PHP SQL) to Object Oriented Programming to 2000 word essays. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not all, I'm the kind of person who helps everyone.. I had to redo some of these assignments twice to help my friends because they aren't so good at programming and always kept calling me to help them and of course I did, sometimes at the expense of my time. But I don't really care about that because I love helping my friends. It just gets really exhausting after a while. I can't seem to be able to take a break from things. My dating life has been quite shit. I've been on two dates since I broke up with my ex. The first girl ghosted me. Second girl we weren't really compatible which is fine. I keep thinking of how I broke up with my ex and the very next day she blocked me off Facebook so she could add that she was in a relationship with some other dude since May... (broke up with her late August) Was probably cheating for longer though and that just feels horrible.. I moved on though, it's just that I sometimes remember this and ask myself how could she have done that... I haven't had any luck finding any internships or placements so far.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've been to so many interview's and I've received so many coding tests from companies to complete. Worst of all are ""video interviews"" where basically a question pops in your screen and you have 3 minutes to record your reply.. just so companies don't spent time to actually interview someone, but this seems so unatural and I get sooo stressed and I just can't do anything. This week I had this coding challenge from this company to create a whole fully functional working ANDROID APP (had to learn everything by myself) which gets data from a json file, through a phpmyadmin database through a php file in a week. The same week I had to write 2000 word essay, and had friends/coursemates who would call me to hang in a cafe so I could help them start their own essay. I managed to do everything, at the expense of me feeling overwhelmed. I can't seem to find any luck with any girl as well, and this bothers me so much in all honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

 I hate getting ghosted, texting someone for some time, asking them out and they just always can't. I feel since girls have so many guys to choose from, they just go for the best, and obviously I am not the best, I'm not some 6'5 super jacked dude. Same goes for companies, they will hire the best person out of everyone, the one who knows more things than just what is taught in uni. And that's not all, I've even tried to compete, through the past 2 summers I created a videogame myself to make atleast some kind of ""project"" to show that I have work outside of uni... I started playing League again but that game stresses me also sooo much. Life is hard.. I'm really sorry, I feel sorry. I wish my life was more comfortable, I wish I had a job to have some sort of income myself.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents provide me with everything they can, at the cost of them having a comfortable lifeas well, by paying for my studies, my food, everything.. and I don't like that feeling, I wanna give something back. I know you'll say that's what parents should do, and while I agree, I just wish I could help the situation a little bit too you know? One of my 2020 goals was to start a youtube channel to just improve with my insecurities and fears and become more confident in myself.. sucks being 5'6 at 136lbs (although workout).. oh about working out.. I've been doing it for so long yet I think I haven't reached the goals that I aspire to have.. yes I do get some people telling me ohh you work out etc, but I feel weak and small in comparison to others..

4592,What does a kiss feel/taste like?,"First a little context (will reveal my age at the end of this explanation). I'm no stranger to saying goodbye to people I know I will never see or hear anything from again, and I've never stayed in one place long enough to form an intimate relationship with anybody. With that being said, I see it very difficult for me to commit to a relationship in the near future. In the first place, the only thing that mattered to me growing up was going to school and coming home to help take care of my two younger sisters, do chores (laundry, dishes, cutting grass, etc.) and I never owned a car until just three years ago and have never been insured automotive or medical, and this year I have worked at my job to the point where I will finally afford auto insurance in the next month. I still live with my dad, his girlfriend, and her 17 and 15-year-old daughters in a house we moved into four months ago, but I pay the utilities while he pays for remodeling the house. A lot of things in my life have prevented me from forming a stable relationship with anyone I cared about or was interested in, and this year I want to change that. I'm currently writing a book that I plan to have edited by mid-February so in between my job, my book, and my home situation, I've not had many opportunities to get to know anybody intimately. I've tried Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, Hily, POF, even Taimi, but what's the point of using any of those apps if you've never had a friend take a photo of you before? I've gone out to a couple of night clubs by myself plenty of times but no matter how much I dance or drink, I can't help but feel empty by the end of the night. So I want to know, just to socially motivate myself in what to strive for the next time I go out to make (more like an attempt to make) a friend or even something more, I want to know one thing; what does it feel/taste like to kiss or to be kissed?

I occasionally get one to two days a week where i only have to do one job, but then i usually need sleep more than anything. Both if my jobs have me on my feet all day so when i am off, i dont usually want to do alot.
 Eating is important i know, but with so little time i usually end up eating at best one meal a day, and ita something i can grab quickly. I try to make good food choices but the options are usually limited.

One day, my friend asked her how things were going with us, and she said the she smiled and told her to shut up. Then, my friend told me that I should tell her my feelings. I did the other night, and she said she isn't sure how to feel yet. She likes me as a friend, but we haven't hung out enough yet to see if it's more than that.

4660,What is the best way to tell my husband I want to have sex with women?,"Hi, men of Reddit! I created an account specifically to ask this question.

My husband is awesome, and I absolutely adore him. We‚Äôre very much in love, and our sex life is rockin‚Äô.

That said, my husband‚Äôs in his thirties and I‚Äôm in my twenties, and I have a ravenous sexual appetite for women that I want to continue exploring while I‚Äôm still young and sexy. I‚Äôm a petite woman with very big natural tits, and women have always been so much better at handling my breasts and helping me achieve climax through tit-play. My husband‚Äôs great in bed, but I find myself constantly fantasizing about having another woman suck on my nipples and massage my clit.

So, all of that said, I want to talk to my husband about inviting women into our sex life. However, he‚Äôs a little bit territorial in the sense that he doesn‚Äôt like to ‚Äúshare‚Äù me, regardless of what gender we‚Äôre discussing. Therefore, I guess I‚Äôm looking for some advice about how to best approach the conversation? In other words, how would you want to be approached by your partner about something like this?

4663,How do you know if you should stop pursuing a girl?,"So here's my situation: I've known this girl for about three years now, we are together in a band, but outside of that we never actually spent time alone together untill recently. I've had a crush on her for a while now, but didn't want to make a move, because she didn't seem to be interested in me. But a couple weeks ago we were kinda forced to hang out by chance for a couple of hours and it was really great, we were talking about a lot of different things and laughed at each other a lot and all that stuff. So i decided i should ask her out for a coffee or something, i did, she said yes, we hung out, it was really cool. I didn't make any moves, we just had a fun time. Then we started texting, it seemed ok at first, but then it turned really onesided, me sending stuff and her responding (although the responses seemed enthusiastic, they didn't lead the convo anywhere). Our schedules are really packed and most of the week we are in different cities, so i asked her out for coffee again the next week, she said yes. It was cool again, we were both really tired after a long day, but it was still fun. Knowing that we are in the same city the next day i suggested that she called me if she had any time. She did not. But ok, that didn't matter to me much. I saw a movie playing that day in the cinema in town and asked her if she had time, she said she was busy and nothing else. I then suggested another date when the movie was playing next week and she said yes. We had a little bit of contact during the week through texts, but it was still mostly one sided. So the day comes, she was working a bit late and came to the caffe about half an hour before the movie started, so we didn't have that much time to talk before the movie but it was still nice. Then after the movie she just said she needs to go, so it ended really weirdly. She was feeling a bit under the weather though, so it was kinda understandable. And she sent me a text saying she is sorry when she came home. The next day when ended up still texting a little bit, but then the convo died out again. I really like this girl, but i am really confused if she likes me back or not, it's really hard to tell.

4665,I (22F) think my shy male flatmate likes me but not sure.," Long story short, I (22F) moved into a house with two guys (let‚Äôs call them Person A and Person B) who are childhood best friends. Both of them are in their mid-to-late 20s. Person A is a lot more outspoken than Person B, and Person B, in my opinion, is a bit more shy around me cause he always fidgets and walks around everywhere whenever I speak to him alone. 

There are various reasons why I keep getting a gut feeling that he likes me: 

* he‚Äôs always curious on where I‚Äôm going in the evenings/weekends, and who with 
* he‚Äôs relatively protective about me (e.g. when I was really drunk at my birthday he wasn‚Äôt the nicest to my guy friends who were taking care of me when he came to pick me up to bring me home)
* whenever we‚Äôre in a group setting, he would always find the opportunity to flirt with me (e.g. making jokes about stuff I‚Äôve done, and tease me for stupid things). If not, he would always speak to them about me. 
* I‚Äôve caught him look at me a few times and noticed that he glances at me all the time whenever I‚Äôm looking at something else
* he remembers the small things about me (remembering that I like sticky toffee pudding, etc) 
* he‚Äôs never spoken to me about relationships/dates/girls. 
* whenever my friends try and flirt with him he would always look straight at me even when it comes to answering their questions. 
* whenever I speak to him there's always a prolonged eye contact that I can't seem to pinpoint on. 
* he always laughs at whatever I do, and he also blushes whenever I speak to him.
* before Christmas he told me he got presents for people he cared a lot about. And on Christmas I found out that he actually got me and Person A each an individually wrapped present. The present itself is a bag with an image of two bunnies kissing. 

But there are also reasons why I think he‚Äôs not into me: 

* he would come back home and go straight to his room 
* he prefers to hang out with our other Person A alone rather than alone with me. 
* he sometimes looks quite uncomfortable/bothered when I speak to him which I don't know if it's just him being moody. 

I just need some advice about this because I also think he is quite cute. Personally I don‚Äôt really want to make a move but I just want to know without asking him if he actually feels something for me. My friend spoke to him on my birthday party when he came to pick me up and apparently he was telling her how cute I was that night - plus she also said that she picked up a vibe from him that he has something for me. I‚Äôve told my friends about this and most of them have said either there‚Äôs ‚Äòsomething there‚Äô or he has a ‚Äòsoft spot‚Äô for me. Thoughts?

4681,Should I marry her?,"I love this girl, but I‚Äôm not sure. We‚Äôre both 35 and in a long distance relationship so I am feeling a little pressure to make up my mind. Since this is a serious question this won‚Äôt be short, but I am at a loss and would appreciate any advice.

About a year ago I lost my job. I‚Äôm born in the states but have Croatian roots with tons of family there, so I decided no better time to see family then when you don‚Äôt have to book a return ticket. So I did. 

Along the way I met a Croatian girl who seemed absolutely amazing.... She was sweet, she had a successful business, she spoke my language and seemed to share common values. I had a 6-figure job in the states and I live in the south where it‚Äôs common for women to date men for their financial support so they could be stay at home wives, so the fact that we would go to dinner and this girl would pay for our bill while I was in the restroom made a huge impression. Plus she cooks, cleans, washes clothes, irons, gets me presents but perhaps the most defining aspect of this relationship to me is: We‚Äôve never been in an argument despite how BRUTALLY honest I am... Because I was a traveler, I moved in with her 3 weeks in to the relationship. Got a job, stayed for 6 months and every day was so pleasant because it was Croatian beaches, and NO arguing or relationship stress! 

The only issue is the sexual chemistry is not on par with other girls I‚Äôve dated. I‚Äôve never liked the way she kissed from the first moment and I don‚Äôt really ever ‚Äúlust‚Äù for her. I‚Äôm a healthy male and she is an attractive 5‚Äô4 blonde so we have regular sex 2-4 times a week along with a great social life. We travel, go out, she is supportive etc. and while I check out other girls all the time, our sex is not bad and the ease and regularity that I get it keeps me from straying. Also, I love and respect her and I wouldn‚Äôt cheat on her....

Now living in Croatia for 9 months I explained that the economy and opportunities don‚Äôt compare. I explained that if I and we wanted to have a life and future and provide the best for children in the future it would not be in Croatia... So 10 months later I moved back trying to start a franchise with my savings in order to support her. We now live 7 times zones away and the plan is for her to find a way to sell her business while I ramp up and then she comes here, but I‚Äôm getting cold feet.

She doesn‚Äôt know too much English (I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll learn) but I brought her for a tour in the summer and she loved it. Honestly she‚Äôd make a perfect mother and a great match for me. I lean towards the skeptic/negative side and she so positive, supportive and caring. She‚Äôs great with kids and she knows my culture/language/religion and we don‚Äôt argue (I‚Äôve tried). She is cute but I always wanted 5‚Äô8 brunette and she‚Äôs a 5‚Äô4 blonde whose kiss doesn‚Äôt turn me on...

She has her own successful business in Croatia and all her family is there so it‚Äôs asking a lot for her to leave it... and I don‚Äôt want to do that to her if things did not go well in our marriage... I mean talk about messing both of our lives up!!

4682,Fellow males why is my perspective on women different and dating became harder?,"Yeah a somewhat misleading double title.
But what I simply want to ask is have you ever experienced a change in your perspective on your taste for future partners and dating game after a relationship with a women whom you really loved but who dumped you? 

In my case it's that now being in my mid twenties I don't care about just having a good looking GF or FWB thing anymore but instead I want someone who has more attributes like a solid income, maybe experience with living on their own, finished university, is loyal and rather a positive person, has no past traumas to project on me and the list goes on. I'm back in dating and it's just so hard to find someone in their 20s who ticks a few points off this list. Sometimes I think going to clubs, bars and stuff isn't the right place to start with. Also tinder and other dating apps became quite shallow. I 2014 and 2018 both times where I freshly came out of a relationship I didn't have to use such things since women where either hitting on me or showed obvious interest. I think I have to learn to approach and find the right spots to meet people.

In my experience, if you can make a girl smile and laugh a lot you have a better chance of having a smooth first date and also a better chance of seeing them again. 

Smiling and laughing brings about a sense of ease and comfort and first dates can be tense at times, so ease that tension by keeping light playful energy with them. 

I have found that the most effective jokes are at your own expense, so the girl has a 'free' chance to laugh :)

4716,"Men who regularly approach women, what's the story of your most memorable failed attempts?","Here's mine.

Some time ago, I was out shopping with my cousins and decided to leave them to look around because they were taking too long. I head over to a nearby coffee shop and spot a really hot girl seating alone.

Now in my experience, seeing a hot girl, especially one thats alone is incredibly rare, so I thought to myself, ""damn this is my chance, don't fuck it up!"" (I fucked it up). So I did a quick fix of my hair, rolled up my sleeves and confidently walked towards her.

As I was walking towards she notices me and puts up her guard, and as soon as I say ""Hi"" she blurts out, in the bitchiest way you can imagine.

""Ugh, I have a boyfriend.""

Now I've experienced it enough times that girls can lie about that, and to some of them its just a test. I was prepared for this.... or so I thought....

I was sweating,

I could feel the fear creeping in my whole body..

My mind went blank and so I just blurted out whatever my mind first thought...

So in a fearing, unmanly way...

I said,

""Oh, me too..""

I quickly realized what I said, but the damage was done. She facepalmed, like a disappointed couch when their NBA basketball team does a rookie mistake and lose the game, she facepalms and laughs in disbelief of how bad things went.

I could do nothing but laugh at my own embarrassment as I walk out the coffee shop, only to embarrass myself further by going back in because I forgot to order my coffee, trying to go about my day like nothing happened.

4727,How to grow into being my own man?,"**TL;DR:** I'm a young adult with daddy issues who really needs advice or some perspective on being more content in masculinity and growing into my gay, non-gender-conforming self, past validating myself with others' opinions.

Hey, AskMen, I'm a young guy who really has had trouble expressing myself being a guy and stuff. I've tried to dismiss it as gender not meaning much to me, but like other times I've lied to myself, this denial is hurting my life and emotional stability.

Generally, I've been considered an emotional and ""feminine"" male, which while not completely incorrect has caused me bullying over the years that has eroded security in my own presentation of being a male. I've been trying to strengthen my identity, but with no prominent positive male role models in my life, I feel lost. Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is the closest thing to a caring dad I have.

Thing is, I feel horrible even saying I want a male role model. I've always wanted to be an individual with my own identity separate from race, gender, sexuality, etc., but I'm realizing those are parts of myself that I connect with. I want to be accepted along with my identit***ies***, not despite them.

All this confusion has gotten to the point where I have sent other guys nudes of myself, just for validation that I'm attractive or worthy in some way (not forcefully mind you, I'd hate myself even more for that). I know that sounds crazy, but the validation from other guys that I'm ""guy-enough"" for them was pleasurable past the sexual aspect. I guess that's ""daddy"" issues for ya.

Also, because I don't have any not-stereotypically-masculine male role models, I'm not even sure how to style my afroamerican hair that I'm trying to grow out that will hopefully help me tackle some parts of my own identity.

All of this probably comes from my family who--as an example of their character--asked me ***twice***, **fearfully**, if I was ***\*gasp\**** **gay**, while I asked for therapy for my depressive symptoms arising from my past, family situation, and identity troubles (not that I told them all that or even that I'm gay).

So, yeah, I'm not sure what I'm doing with myself as a man. I want to be male, but I'm not sure how to live a happy life that way. I have some surprisingly supportive friends for a rural, Christian town, but I'm still scared, hesitant, unsure, etc. Typical feelings for post-teen pre-adults, I'm sure, but it's all the more real nonetheless.

She tries to flirt with me a lot, hits me a lot (playfully), says double entendre a lot. I don't want to be a homewrecker so I try to just be nice but I have to admit I flirt a little bit and appreciate the attention.  


At work she did something small for me and said something along the lines of 'if I have to do this (insert thing that would take 5 seconds to do) again you owe me a coffee' so I had to have her do it again and she stared at me looking serious about her 'offer' and I didn't know what to do so I just brushed it off laughing awkwardly. I don't want to help her cheat, but idk the best way to tell her how I feel, especially in a work setting where we have almost no private time to talk. I also don't know if I should even consider going somewhere with her (I'll probably have to drive us, she has no car right now) and Im not even sure if they live together, or if its okay to even get coffee with someone who is engaged at all since, personally I have always decided to never do anything even remotely close to cheating when I was in a relationship.  


Honestly I feel dumb about not knowing the perfect course of action in this situation. I should know better but really don't know the protocol.

So I entered my second semester of college a few weeks ago and went out of my to talk to women(I never dated beforehand). Many times, these women wouldn't show the same interest back and it never went anywhere. However, I met this one girl from my Chem lecture and we quickly bonded over the past two weeks. 

I finally pulled the trigger last Friday and asked her out to lunch after our Chem lecture. I was super nervous, but she agreed! I can't tell you how happy I was when she said yes. All of my guy freinds made a big deal about it and congratulated me (I know, it's cringe but it was my first date haha)

I texted her yesterday afternoon asking when she was available for Tuesday. She didn't reply back all day yesterday, even though she was snapchatting, and finally sent a response this morning. She basically said she wasn't into me and didn't see us more than freinds. She said she only said yes in the heat of the moment to not make it awkward.

Of course, I feel awful, but how can I get over this? My confidence(which was already low) is at an all time low. I hated myself these past two months and have been heavily insecure( short- 5'7, higher pitched voice and small hands).

4775,Should I do d*ck move and break up? Judgments welcome,"  

TLDR: M20 thinking about abandoning relationship to try other things.  
  

Well, I am 20-year-old male and often I am unintentionally d\*ck person. I mean, I have girlfriend, we met in summer and it was the most awesome summer ever for both of us. We went camping several times and etc. Then we started university, my girlfriend had random sadness and anger issues and she always said things that made me so upset, that I had to turn my phone off to not think about that.... Well, once I went at my university course (it was like 3 day stay at school, sports, dance and etc.) and I just had to turn off my phone again... I was so upset and went to have dance with my friends (it was better than sitting somewhere alone and sad.) I am not party guy but if I do party with my friends, I can do all the crazy dances and etc‚Ä¶ and then I ended up on slow dance with girl (there was nothing wrong with it, we were just chatting and got dancing together just by accident... BUT there was a spark between us, like huge spark and we actually spend rest of the night smiling at each other and talking (but still, just as friends, no flirting and anything like that), it was nice but I was sure I want to stay with my gf.... But that spark never left me (and never left her)... She knows I am in relationship and when I tried to turn her down, she said she really likes who I am, my personality and she is going to wait. She is the kindest person I know and even thou she is not the sharpest one ( but honestly, I am also not the sharpest too), she is super hard working (I can brain out lot of things without much effort, but she can learn anything she wants (she has a strong will))  
   
 

3 Months later, me and my gf had really hard time understanding each other, we broke up and I just started to talk to THAT girl again and bought her flower just to make her happy (there was no date but it was still d\*ck move in my mind). Well one month after breakup my exgf wrote me, we started chatting and I decided I want to try that relationship again, because of that awesome summer. We are still together, I doesn‚Äôt work perfectly, especially while we are chatting (I am quite a busy person, I have my work as IT specialist and also I do tech help, web development, develop my own arduino solutions and repair/build laptops/PCs, graphics stuff and etc. so chatting is must and we were together for ""only"" about 20 hours a week). 

 And now I am here, we are arguing a lot while chatting but most of time when we are together, everything is fine and we are quite happy together. I think our personalities are ""incompatible"" in long run, and after one pregnancy scare, I realized I am not sure if she is my person for life (I would never leave her if she would be pregnant), but I don¬¥t want to break up with her (actually half of me wants to break up because I am not sure if she is the correct person for me (she is crazily unproductive, stubborn, often lazy, don¬¥t like to study but also loving and intelligent person)).

4777,Would it be creepy to send follow request to a guy after a month of no contact and no mutuals?,So I‚Äôm from a country where dating or talking to guys openly is considered a bit of a taboo. Few months ago I joined a gym near my apartment complex. There‚Äôs this guy also from my apartment complex who I realised liked me at the gym. I also started liking him and finally last month he got the courage to speak to me. Due to work I had to stop going to the gym for a month and when I returned he had stopped coming to the gym too. I tried finding him on social media but he had deactivated his accounts. But last week I saw his account on Instagram under people you might know.  Would it be ok or would it be creepy to send him a follow request even though we have no mutuals and a month has passed since we talked that one time at the gym?

I could go on for a short novel about all the shitty treatment I receive daily, but I'll stick to the point, how did you end a relationship like this? I think the only reason I've stayed so long is fear I won't find someone else, fear of going back to my parents after being independent for so long and not knowing how to pick my life back up, and not knowing got to pick up women down the line as I've been in this  on and off since high school

I have aspersions in life, but one of them has always been a family, and j just don't know how to end this, or where to go from here as I've never had any kind of time role model to teach me these things....

I can't do push-ups, due to an injury that screwed up my shoulders. I've not really noticed other issues except for when I'm doing butterflies or similar movements. (My sister's an occupational therapist and she thinks I screwed up the cartilage or joint in that direction.)

He seemed to want to make eye contact with me more so than i would consider normal. When I went to walk away he kept trying to find something else to say or comment on and mentioned that I could always call in and ask for him the following day to see when the shipment would come in as he said he would put it in the order that evening.

Several years later, we happened to pursue graduate school abroad at the same country. He actually started 1 year earlier than me. As we have more time here meeting each other and we don't have many friends here, we are getting closer. We go to the supermarket, department stores, cook, go to the exhibition. We have a lot of things to talk and quite comfortable with asking each other out for a meeting. It is just frustrating that things seem to be just like this and can't get further though I think my signalling is quite clear but then I somehow can read from conversations that he still enjoys single life and has no intention of being in a relationship. As a girl, my ideal relationship is to have it start as friends and we somehow know each other well and are comfortable around each other. I am more like seeking for a right one and make the time right. And we have seen each other like more than 20 times this year and I can say that it is not really kind of close friends' hangouts.

So I‚Äôve been chatting with this guy I used to briefly know from work years ago turns out he‚Äôs moved back from traveling it‚Äôs been almost 8 years since we‚Äôve seen each other.  (To be clear I barely knew him at work and nothing sexual happened)

So we matched on a dating sight and had been texting back and forth a lot but it was over the holidays and I was away visiting my family so we hadn‚Äôt physically met up. Things got heated we started sexting. But out conversation were great and sweet every morning I‚Äôd wake up to a text from him and go to bed with one. Sooo after a couple weeks we finally meet up and it was wild. Soo much sex and kissing 5 times in one night. 

I‚Äôm asking if you guys look at us different if we hook up on the first date?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eqlvlo/sex_on_first_date/,1579379474

5005,How do I get over the formality hump in pursuing a relationship?,"The title might be a bit confusing, but the question I have is this. I don't have any problem talking to anyone once a conversation is started. As long as I have stuff to add to the conversation, talking is not a problem. The problem is I don't know how to veer things towards a more intimate tone. Not only that but I'm scared to even try, especially with people that I only kinda know or just met. 

In other words, when it comes to conversing with people about anything I don't have a problem, but the moment I think I want to pursue something with someone I hit a massive wall, and just have no idea where to start or what to say. 

I suppose some background, I'm 21 going to university, and my last and only relationship was at the end of freshman year of high school.

Do people kinda understand what I'm talking about? Have you gone through something like this? How did you better yourself in this area? Who knows maybe I'm asking the wrong question.

5011,do men find tears/crying very alarming?,"So I've always been an emotional woman since I was a child (my parents didn't have the greatest relationship) and I'm the type of person to internalize my stress in order to not let it interfere with my work. I tend to cry and listen to music as a way of releasing my stress and negative emotions, because I feel infinitely better afterwards (I suppose it's like a coping mechanism). it's similar to how some people watch sad or dramatic movies (e.g. the notebook or me before you) to release &amp; forget about stress. 

my bf of about 9 months (and 3 years as a friend) is concerned about my crying habits. he thinks that I am depressed and he is also worried that he's a bad boyfriend that can't stop his gf from crying. I have told him countless times that I'm not crying because of him nor am I depressed, but rather it's a way for me to release stress (just like how he plays video games and takes naps). I've also told him that for me, I need to cry before facing stressful situations because then I can release my negative emotions and gain a clearer, more logical attitude towards the problem at hand. Also, I have been crying less lately because I've been finding other active ways to release my stress such as reading, yoga, and going out with my close girl friends.

but he still thinks that I am depressed &amp; that he is a bad boyfriend. of course, his concern is understandable and I appreciate the fact that he cares. but I want him to understand that my tears are not an indicator of sadness or depression, but rather a way for me to relieve my stress and emotions at the end of a tough day. 

men of reddit, are tears/crying THAT alarming/strange to you? how can I reassure my bf that I'm okay and that he is a good boyfriend?

5025,"Why is sex an essential part of love, an expression of it, yet sex alone can‚Äôt get you love?","
I apologize in advance if I make this too much about my biased experiences. 

I‚Äôm a 20 year old runway and lingerie model living in New York. I‚Äôve been fully immersed in the adult world since I was 16 and have heard a lot of tales about marriages that break up due to lack of sex, or how sexual attraction is the foundation of any romantic relationship. 

When I turned 18 I started escorting through my agency to supplement my income and saw first hand all that men ( and some women) would put on the line ( thousands of dollars a night, their careers and reputations) to get some sex. 

I‚Äôve slept with many individuals and couples who have immense power but would make themselves vulnerable for sex. These are people who are known to be cruel and hardened but they would become sweet during sex. 

I‚Äôve fallen for a lot of my clients, in particular a couple that say that they‚Äôd do anything for me. I spend all my time giving them the most mind blowing sex, making all their wild fantasies come true. And they‚Äôd even tell me they loved me and say they would give up their empire for some mind blowing sex.

But when I was in a really desperate emotional situation, even when I still gave great sex they would change the subject when I looked for support. When I ask for them to listen, they might do so for a few seconds but then they want the clothes to come off again. Yet they can hold me like I‚Äôm their ultimate valentine after they orgasm and say they love me.

I realize they don‚Äôt love me. Yet the absence of the sex I give them causes men and women to leave long marriages. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôve seen men and women share the most intimate acts with me and then when they think I‚Äôm out of earshot they talk about me like I‚Äôm just another person they happened to know. 

I don‚Äôt know why they would call sex making love anymore. Love is such a valuable thing yet people treat sex like the most important and most trivial thing ever.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eqky1l/why_is_sex_an_essential_part_of_love_an/,1579375349

5041,"Why is long distance worth it, when is it the right time?","I already asked a question over on r/LongDistance, but I came here to see what you guys think.

TLDR: I just got into a new LDR with my girlfriend under the impression that our end date was sometime within a year. Over the phone, she told me that she was thinking about staying out of state for another 4 years. I want her to do whatever she wants and whatever makes her happy, but I don't know if I have it in me to do an LDR for 4 years.

Long Explanation: I am about 5 days into a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend of about 2 weeks. Now that I am saying that out loud it sounds kinda crazy, but let me explain.

I recently ended things with my ex-girlfriend (we will call her Mary \[19F\]), we had been talking for about 5-6 months and had been officially dating for about 2-3 months. We ended up breaking up because I realized I had just kind of fallen out of love with her, I was no longer happy with the relationship. Around that same time, my ex-ex girlfriend (we will call her Jane \[18F\]) just got back in town for Thanksgiving break from college. We ended up hanging out and the first night we just caught up. But then Jane and I were basically talking throughout the whole entire day and we ended up hanging out almost every night during the break (abt 7 days until she went back). Over the course of the rest of the semester, we facetimed/texted all of the time, and when she got back from Winter break we of course continued to spend a ton of time together.

Jane (explained): Jane is my ex-girlfriend (turned new girlfriend) that I dated for 6 months back in my senior year of high school, she was a junior at the time. Jane was my first real girlfriend that I truly loved and cared about and it was an amazing 6 months. But things started to change during the end of it and I could feel myself slipping out of the relationship. I ended up cheating on Jane with another girl (not sex though) and that was what ended our relationship. I honestly felt so horrible about it and mad at myself (I was also drunk when it happened), that I told Jill that I really felt like we should spend some time apart. I decided on this because for a while we tried to make it work, but she couldn't hang out with me without feeling like shit. So, in the end, we broke up.

Fast forward to this last semester, when I started dating Mary. She was amazing, and the first couple months were awesome. But then with a combination of things, I started to fall out of the relationship with Mary. We ended up breaking up around Thanksgiving break, where Jane comes back into the picture.

When Jane and I first started dating again, it was about 2 weeks ago and I was under the impression that she was going to come back to¬†our home state within a semester to at most a year. We were talking a couple of days ago and she brought up the fact that she is thinking about doing 4 years of school out of state. As much as I love her, I just don't know if I have the capacity to do an LDR for another 4 years. Hell, I am only 5 days in and I miss her so much, it is probably one of the hardest things that I have ever had to do. So I brought up my thoughts and how I was feeling with her, and she thought that I was being selfish. Her reasoning was that I tell her all the time about how I would do anything for her, but that I wouldn't be able to do an LDR with her for longer than a semester. I told her I am open to the idea of a longer LDR, but that I just wasn't expecting it at the time. Luckily she is only a 6.5-hour drive away from me, but our schedules work out where we would only be able to see each other 1-2 times a month and I would be the one driving to the other person the majority of the time (she doesn't have a car). She asked me why can't we just take it one step at a time? I told her I think it would be a good idea to have an end date in mind.

5056,I can't tell if he likes me," I've started this math class at my college that I go to once a week. I was late my first day so the only seat available was next to this cute guy. During that class we like joked around, but it was nothing that really caught my attention. So when it finished I walked out and got in my car to go home. Once I got on the freeway home I was in the fast lane behind a car that was driving slow. Mind you, it is 8 pm and there aren't many cars on the road right now. So I move over to try and pass, but as I speed up, the other car speeds up and won't let me pass. Of course i'm annoyed so I look over and see the guy from my class looking over and like laughing at me. We are both going the same way, he lives 20 from my house. So we like ""raced"" and he drove right next to me until I had to take my exit. So as next week comes along, I was joking around and told him he was driving so slow, and he was like ""I was slowing down because I thought it was funny."" During that class we both tease each other quite a bit, but like I'm so bad at knowing if he's really into me.

Our communication with each other is ideal and what I always wanted in a relationship. We have met each other‚Äôs families and both got the thumbs up from them at this stage.  His mom even told him privately a few weeks ago not to lose me. 
This week he told me he loved me for the first time and I reciprocated. Then he kind of slid into our conversation that he can see himself marrying me. 
Kind of surprised me that he just blatantly said it, and I‚Äôm not sure how to take it. Thoughts? He‚Äôs 29 and I‚Äôm 31 if that matters?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eqhcv0/when_men_mention_marriage/,1579359635

5133,How do I save myself?,"At 18 I suffered a life-threatening injury that rendered me unable to attend college.  Suffering an ""Anoxic Brain Injury and Cardiac Arrest"", my confidence, self-esteem, mood and many other aspects of life I worked so hard to build seemingly plummeted after this single event.  I spent a long time solely recovering from my injury with the one goal of returning to school.  I'm currently 24, back in college and there are many aspects of my life I could complain about but I really just want to feel capable again.

That was what I felt at the core of my being prior to my injury.  A semi-sold foundation that was built upon my experiences with friends, girls, PE class, swimming, socializing and other things.  When I woke up, I was ready to face this life we all live in.  I knew not everything would go my way or even as planned but that's how it was.

Since I woke up from my comatose state and been conscious, I don't feel like a man or even that I'm growing/improving.  Rather I feel like a boy.  I've retracted into my shell/shy-nature that I broke out of in high school and I don't know what to reverse this.  I'm timid, quiet and scared.  Somewhere along the way I rediscovered my love for anime and video games and can literally shut myself in my room for the next decade.

What I'm asking is how do I save myself from a life of mediocrity or maybe even less than that with where I'm headed?  I'm currently travelling and visiting my father.  I live with my single mother, 2 brothers and am an uncle to one of my brother's two children.  I've spoken with my father and he describes that I am yet to cut my umbilical cord to my mother.  I love my mother to death but believe his vague statement is wrong as many things happened after my injury which resulted in me living a quite solitary and boring lifestyle.

I feel week and don't know what to do with myself in this life.  I've felt like this many times before but ended up retracting into myself.  Men of Reddit, how do you suggest I save myself and turn my life around?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eqh4st/how_do_i_save_myself/,1579358451

5139,Have I ruled out any possibility of a relationship if I hooked up with a guy at a party?,"Context : I [26F] had some drinks and went home with a guy [31M] I met that night. Just about 1 month before, I got out of a relationship of 1,5 yrs, and I also had a mild crush on the bartender who invited me to the said party. I let this new guy know about these aspects. 

One week later we met again at the same venue, but this time at some fair we were both participating in, I was selling my artworks and he was there as an event photographer. While I was there he took me aside and said that he had a really nice time with me, and he does not usually act like this, not saying anything, but he was sick, and anxious, and he kew he'll see me again at this event, blabla, I didn't take him seriously. I said okay. 

We then talked about spending NYE at the same location, and so we did. We hooked up again after that night. And a few times after. 

Once I tried to ask him to get out for a drink, but he said he didn't want to get out and then invited me to his place for a drink. So I just tought okay, it's clearly just a casual relationship. 

Another evening we were chatting online and my phone was flooded with notifications as he liked almost every photo of mine on Instagram.

We haven't set any clear boundaries of what kind of relationship this is. I am not very invested emotionally as I actually don't really know him, but I like the kind of guy he is, and the sex is really great. He didn't seem to mind cuddling afterwards either.

I keep thinking of him a lot, and I feel like I would like to know him better but I'm scared it's too soon and I might ruin the dynamics if I open up this subject.

TL;DR: I hooked up with a guy I never met before at a party and now I feel like I ruined a good bf material by going home with him.

I'm 27 and for reasons that mainly concern to my mental health (mostly anxiety, self-image issues) I'm a virgin. Sometimes I'm with my friends and they start to talk about sex, not in a bragging way, but mostly sharing and discussing opinions about it. This makes me insanely depressed. I believe they know I never had it, so I think they don't push me to talk about it, but still it's really bad to stand there and not participating and no really knowing what t do.  
In one hand I don't think they should stop talking about it just because of me, it would be selfish of me to ask them to do so and since it's not done in a harmful way, I don't think they do it in a harmful way. On the other hand I don't know how to react.

5194,How to make lasting male friendships in your late twenties,"TLDR: 28 male who has struggled to make lasting friendships seeks advice on how to make and hold friendships, and what exactly you should expect from a good male to male friendship 

I‚Äôm 28 and am in a bit of a social rut.

I‚Äôve been sick for about two years, and while I have made some friends during that time, I‚Äôve had a hard time extending those friendships beyond the contexts that I meet them in.

I do have one good mate, but he lives far away and we only catch up about twice a month, sometimes it can be a couple of months before we see each other. I have another good friend from childhood, but he lives in a different city so we don‚Äôt speak much. We play phone tag a lot. 

I have a girlfriend who is great, but I need more male friends. I‚Äôm not socially bereft, but I am lonely sometimes and would like to make some more meaningful friendships with guys my own age.

I tried mini war gaming through a local hobby store and met some guys through that. Some are cool, some are just weird. It‚Äôs hit and miss when I bump into them because the store isn‚Äôt near where I live. I‚Äôve been thinking about potentially trying another store as well just for variety - but truthfully I‚Äôm just nowhere near as into it as they are. And they don‚Äôt seem to have a lot of interests beyond it really. They‚Äôll be sitting there geeking out about rules and stats, but I‚Äôm mostly interested in painting them. And I‚Äôm a slow painter and don‚Äôt spend as much on the hobby as they do. 

I want to get back into BJJ or maybe Muay Thai, but I‚Äôm to broke to afford that and a gym membership right now. The gym membership is cheaper, but the customer base there is older and I haven‚Äôt met anyone through there. I‚Äôve also gained about 40kg from 2 years of quite bad physical health. While I am working out regulalry (3-5 a week depending), I‚Äôm struggling to regulate calories and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not losing weight. 

I am still in university. 6 years in to a three year degree (thanks, undiagnosed ADHD). I have made friends in different courses before, but they tend to fizzle our after the course is over. I make an effort to extend the friendships outside by organising times to get lunch, but it‚Äôs always me who does the organising I‚Äôve found. None of them have lasted more than six months or so.

In all honesty, it‚Äôs so much easier to meet and sleep with women than it is to make friendships with men. That‚Äôs been my experience anyway. Maybe it‚Äôs just the kind of personality I have. 

I think as well I can inadvertently be too keen. ADHD does make you enthusiastic and curious, and sometimes I think I can be a bit much. I think I can make people feel like they‚Äôre being interviewed. I don‚Äôt mean to do it, I just don‚Äôt know how else I‚Äôm supposed to go about figuring them out. An older friend with ADHD has told me that often people with adhd just move to quickly for others, I guess that may be what happens.

I‚Äôm not socially retarded anymore. I definitely was when I was younger, but I can be quite popular in my work circles (depending on the place I worked at). The place I work at now is populated by older people who are dull. I‚Äôm interviewing for another role now, so hopefully that‚Äôll put me back around other people my age.

I‚Äôve always struggled to make an maintain friendships though. I‚Äôm really good at meeting people, just not at extending the friendships. I don‚Äôt really get invited to parties anymore (I don‚Äôt know anyone who hosts them to be fair). I used to really be into weed and ecstasy. I don‚Äôt do either anymore because they make me more anxious than I like to be. Sometimes it can be hard to find people who I relate to because of that - they just aren‚Äôt that interesting to me. And then the ones who dp drugs who I find interesting make me anxious because I don‚Äôt like to do drugs anymore. It‚Äôs tricky. 

I also just plain struggle to trust people. My best friend from high school turned out to be a massive narcissist and fucked with my head a lot. Another friend of mine who was older manipulated me and fucked with my head - to the point where there were times I feared for my safety. I understand not everyone is bad, but my radar for bad people may be a bit over zealous. 

Friendships with women are more what I‚Äôve had. Emotional turn taking, lots of talking and back and forth. More just hanging out. As I got older I realised that in most cases, I was actually wanting to sleep with that girl and not being honest about it. Now I do have the good friendships with women, but they‚Äôre sexual relAtionships 90% of the time. I am currently in a monogamous relationship.

I‚Äôm bringing that up because...well I don‚Äôt really understand how to have ongoing friendships with men. It seems to be about activities. It‚Äôs not just about hanging out and talking shit. Drugs seem to be a big factor (even if we‚Äôre just talking about booze). 

The guys who I am closer friends with are super open. They are the ones who I have long talks with and who I just hang out and eat a good meal with. I don‚Äôt find many dudes who are like that though. Maybe I need to look for a different kind of friendship with men?

This is a ramble. I just wanted to write something out. My question is how do you go about turning acquaintances into friends, and how do you then turn those friendships into deeper friendships?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eqei9a/how_to_make_lasting_male_friendships_in_your_late/,1579340663

I grew up in a minority household and the culture my parents come from has very dated views of gender roles and gender in general. Although I grew up in the States, where these views are very conservative, the exposure to this sort of left a bit of an ugly scar. I unfortunately have a negative relationship with my father and brothers so I've never had a real positive male role model to ask questions to concerning things like this. Although I've learned a lot on my own and have had positive sexual experiences before, I haven't been able to shake this bad viewpoint as much as I've wanted to. I realize that the viewpoint is wrong and bigoted towards women, and I don't want to have it, which is why I've been trying my hardest to shake it off.

I invited to a bar nearby my work, and we had a few drinks, we had such a great night, we ended up doing Molly and going to the park around 1am where he sang songs for me and we lay down looking the stars, we spent 2 nights together in a row.

I noticed he is very affectionate and warm, he kisses me, he holds my hand, hugs me, he is caring and smart, we only text to plan our dates besides that he doesn't text to catch up (I guess he is not a great texter), he is kinda mysterious, I don't know and I can't tell what does he is looking for I know the only way to find out is to ask him but I am very shy, introverted, insecure and I am scared to be rejected, I noticed he still uses his dating profile (even updated it with a new picture), I have the feeling he goes on dates with other girls and I  feel it's too soon to have the DTR talk (it has been 3 weeks since our first date), I am getting to know him more and I just don't want to crash, I need to find out what does he is looking for without scare him.

Should I wait? Should I let him take the first move? Should I look for the signs? Should I speak up about my feelings? I don't know what to do without sounding desperate ( I tend to fall in love very easy)

5248,How do I stop thinking female interaction is them showing romantic interest in me?,"I'm not really sure how to approach this but I'll try to explain my perspective. I started a new internship last week and it's a big change from my previous experience, much larger group, more diverse, highly competitive, and a lot more interaction with female coworkers. Today I go in a bit earlier than usual and start working, around 9 the rest of the interns show up except for one, this chick shows up a bit late and sits next to me since no other seats are available.

Throughout the day she starts asking me a bunch of work-related questions, occasionally she does this thing where she looks in my direction says something softly as if she's expecting a response but she's not, and she does this weird thing where she looks at me as if she wants to say something but she doesn't say anything. I don't think this is anything, but while I was thinking about the ""signals"" I realized I do this a lot with the females I interact with where I interpret a regular conversation as flirting or some sort of interest in me.

Later in the day me and my brother were just hanging out and talking shit and this came up in conversation and he jokingly compared me to Joe from the Netflix show [You](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211991), I thought it was funny but I also think there was some truth in what he said, the tendency to over examine social interactions is unhealthy.

5268,"Men that are married or in a LTR, what is a funny/ weird/ awkward experience happened to you as a result of living with a woman long term, that would never happen to a single man, or male roommates?","I‚Äôve been with my wife for nearly 15 years now, and one thing that constantly gives me a new ‚ÄúWTH?‚Äù moment is the places I find her hair. SWMBO has long (mid back length) very fine blonde hair. I‚Äôve found her hair woven into the seam stitching of my work truck which she has never driven, and only ridden in a handful of times. I‚Äôve gotten them wound between my toes because they‚Äôve gotten into my socks and over the work day tied themselves around my toes. I‚Äôve pulled them out of every piece of clothing I own at one point or another. I‚Äôve even had one wrap itself around a tooth like a piece of floss somehow. Pulled them out of the dogs (both ends) and the cat. 
But today, a new and surprising hair discovery happened. About halfway through my day, I started to feel a strange and mildly uncomfortable sensation around my boys, plums, wedding tackle, nuts, balls, testicles, or whatever refer to them as. When I first noticed it, it just felt strange. So I manually adjusted, and the tightening feeling got stronger. At that point I just reached into my boxers to try and locate the cause of my ‚Äúdiscomfort‚Äù. 

Turns out a couple of my wife‚Äôs sheddings had knotted into a literal clove hitch (ok, it might have been a bowline or anchor hitch, I was more concerned with removing the offending hairs than examining the knot work) around my sac that was tightening itself as I moved. I broke the constrictors with little force, but I just had [this reaction ](https://i.imgur.com/c2XimCY.gifv) for the next while. 

That‚Äôs a lot of words for a story about my balls. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll think of other relevant female caused stuff that‚Äôs happened over the years, but his just happened today and I‚Äôm still kinda shocked. 

FYI, the spousal unit found it hilarious that her delicate golden locks tried to make me into a eunuch today, and has been terrorizing me with strands of her castration filaments all evening.

5276,Advice on mental health,"I don't know where to post this. I posted something similar on [r/selfhelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/) but didn't get any responses, so I hope this is the right place.

So this is something I can't quite get over. The mainstay advice if you're unattractive is to basically get in shape and become physically fit. I've been going to the gym for 2 years, have made okay progress but honestly am not where I should be. Because I'm not at my potential looks-wise, I feel worthless about who I currently am. I don't want to be happy until I've reached my full potential and this is causing a lot of anguish. When I look at gym transformation pictures, I don't feel motivated to change myself. Instead I feel bitter and resentful about how much better my life would be if I looked good and feel pity for my current meek self. There is no logic to these feelings. Of course it would be better to be strong and have muscles than to not, but to me this is synonymous with the paradigm that until I've reached that goal, I basically suck and am worthless. I just can't stand the thought of people in the future liking me because I've reached (lets face it) an evolutionary standard of male attractiveness, whereas before that I was a loser worth no ones time.

Has anybody else dealt with this? I want to change for the better, but I also don't want the journey to be painful. I could really use an eye opener right now, or some book recommendations/general advice.

I know about self pleasure, I find the paper towel all the time (all clear crusty, sometimes slight yellow tint) 

I found a recent piece (I know it was found within 1-6 hours of the deed). The paper towel I found was with the crusty stuff (I know what it is). This time it had a brown tint in places. It looks as if it was wiped across skin to get the rest of it. It looks like what it looks like if there is slightly dried /old blood from a woman, mixed with the pleasure fluids. Am I making enough sense? 

Anyway, men, is there a reasonable explanation for this other than an extra marital relation? 

Please enlighten me, even if it‚Äôs the worst possible thought running through my head.

I (20yr M) have started to be called out by some close friends for not loving myself and think that I have no choice but to address it. 

Despite being told that I‚Äôm a decent looking guy at worst, I‚Äôve had issues with confidence and body image for years. My first girlfriend made comments about my...anatomy that left me shamed, and since that point I have been scared to be intimate with anyone else. Discovering porn around that same time didn‚Äôt help and made me even more scared bc of the stereotype around black guys, which i don‚Äôt fit into. On top of this, I was bullied most of schooling until I started to play sports in high school. Even after the tide started turning on how others saw me, I have never been able to get the hurtful comments of that girlfriend and all the a-hole kids in primary school out of my head, and it still affects me to this day.

I already work out pretty regularly, am funny, and generally personable. Outside of my physical appearance, I am happy with myself and confident. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to like who I see in the mirror, and can‚Äôt even take a compliment.

5349,"When can a girl act ""too much like a guy?""","My male to female friend ratio is about 3 to 1. I've always gotten along more with boys (and men, for that matter) than women and girls. I always chalked it up to the fact I have more in common with ""stereotypical boy"" things: Cars, Video Games (I have an entire collection of consoles and games), Porn, Money... etc. In translation I just levitated towards these things growing up and currently. Make up and nails don't interest me either, I only wear makeup for special occasions and such. I'm also significantly less emotional than most women that even my therapist picked up on it and so have my male friends, and I think logically and often have the level head in the group when everyone else is panicking or arguing. 

However, I'm also starting to wonder if these traits are also my downfall. 

Now, I'm not about rant about anything I really just want some male advice because I'm not a guy, but I have noticed that although all of my male friends have easily became my friend and latched on to me I started learning that they initially had crushes on me. It makes sense, but then as I talk to them and started asking why they never said anything I get the weirdest answers. One of my friends said that they thought they didn't have a chance and I'd be angry at them, another said that I didn't look interested in really anybody, therefore he would be wasting his breath, another said that I was more like a legitimate homie than an opportunity to date the more we got to know each other, and one said he friendzoned himself because ""we got along so well that he realized that he would have no one to argue with"" (This one got me). Other answers I've gotten are the typical ones, too scared, thought I'd stop being friends with them, etc. 

My 3 closest male friends, the ones I hang out with one on one, take me to dinner, get me gifts, tell me about their personal lives and I actually show affection to, that everyone said I should've dated, I haven't dated because of specific reasons: One is gay [18M] and I helped him figure out he was gay, One I've known since we were in the 4th grade [20M] and we're not each others type, and One is 7 years my senior [27M] and we know it would be short term because we have different goals. However I explained to them my issue I'm running into and they all said that there isn't anything wrong with me (literally, the [27M] said I was just too young). However the [18M] said I might be coming off more as a homie than a potential girlfriend and I should start acting more feminine. I thought he was crazy. I don't dress like a guy, and I clearly look like a female. Plus I was wondering if his version of female was the stereotype which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. 

I've also had a boyfriend, but I was acting completely different than I actually was so he would be be satisfied. Once I started showing who I truly was, from the fact I didn't want kids or settle down, cutting my hair, and my major was Economics- he was repulsed. We didn't last long after that, even though we dated for 4 years. I didn't know what was wrong with him, and I thought he just wanted someone submissive... but as I look around... it seems like these guys are kind of intimidated at me or I give off a wrong vibe. Am I really not feminine enough?

I also don't go out of my way to show interest, it's just not my style, I really just perfer you tell me if you are and I'll tell you how I feel and if it'll work or not. I'm not about to make a scene about it or anything... a proposal, sure... just asking me out on a date, no...

Is there any advice on this? I mean I don't plan on changing who I am for male attention at all, and I am only 19 so I have decades to actually find someone who actually fits me. I'm just wondering if being ""too much like a guy"" can be an issue.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eq9cq1/when_can_a_girl_act_too_much_like_a_guy/,1579308329

I wish to have a sex life as normal as possible, but I'm having a hard time imagening it, because I'm scared ill have a 3cm long one, which I'm afraid won't get very far with, so to speak.

REALLY interested in what men have to say about this! please contribute ‚ô° 

‚Äî‚Äî

scenario I: you and your domestic lady partner (gf, wife, w/e) share equal responsibility financially and domestically. you are supposed to do chore A daily (i.e. scoop ur cat‚Äôs litter box, your partner is allergic), and both partners are expected to clean up after themselves. you‚Äôve consistently forgotten to do chore A, not because you don‚Äôt care and are lazy, only because you have a poor memory. so, nearly every other day your lady partner notices chore A hasn‚Äôt been done, and asks you to do it. in your ideal reality, how does she ask you? (answering: ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù is valid, if the bother is in being asked in the first place, i‚Äôm also interested in knowing that.) 

&gt; scenario Ib: everyday your lady partner asks you to put your dishes in the kitchen, clean up your spills / messes, pick up your socks, throw away your wrappers, cans, etc. you are expected, just as she is, to maintain a clean environment in the basic ways people do. you don‚Äôt keep up on your part, and throw your garbage on the ground, leave dishes to mold, knock things over and not pick them up, tear apart a cupboard searching for something and don‚Äôt put the things back or close the door, dirty laundry everywhere, etc. the two of you have discussed a tiring number of times the expectation, the importance, etc. you‚Äôre trying, you really are, for her at least, but you just fundamentally are messy. she doesn‚Äôt want to remind you, she doesn‚Äôt want to ask an adult man to clean up after himself, but she must, or it won‚Äôt happen. in your ideal reality, how does she ask you? (‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù is still a valid answer.) 

‚Äî‚Äî

in both scenarios you‚Äôre being repeatedly asked to do something you‚Äôre expected to do anyway. is that nagging? is there a way to remind or ask that you‚Äôd prefer? is it different when it‚Äôs your father or male room mate?

Just to clarify, I‚Äôm mixed with black and asian and ended up having thick course hair when I was young. Because of health reasons, my hair is thinning recently. I decided to chop it off very short and stick with natural looking wigs. Never really been open about it unless they ask. 

My ex girlfriend (who is white) loved my wigs. In fact, she would always suggest different colors and get excited whenever I came out with a new look. We broke up, so now I‚Äôm seeing a man this time (who is also white). He‚Äôs a Tinder date, but doesn‚Äôt know about my hair situation. 

I‚Äôm just curious if his attraction would deter. Many of my friends, girlfriends, boyfriends who were black - they didn‚Äôt mind. They saw it like an extension to beauty; similar to makeup, I guess. 

So what do you all think? And should I be upfront with my date?

5441,How do you guys deal with being ghosted?,"I can‚Äôt understand how this is so popular these days. I‚Äôve literally been ghosted by 20 women in a row. It always goes the same way, meet at a bar/somewhere and exchange information (usually Facebook), start chatting, and out of nowhere the messages stay unread and there is no response. 

Let‚Äôs look at 2 cases that just happened today:

Know a girl through a friend and I have her number and she messages me for a doobie. I run it out to her and we sit in her car chatting for a while. I send her a message saying maybe we can chat somewhere other than her car. One message, no pressure and no follow up. 2 weeks later she messages me back saying how sorry she was for not responding and that yeah she‚Äôs definitely down to chill some time. I say that sounds great, it‚Äôs nice out next week how about then some time? No response. Follow up a couple days later with a suggestion, nothing. What gives? She could have just left it at the first message but she messages me back just to ignore me. 

Second girl I met through a job and we chat for a few days online. She is super friendly likes my jokes and the mid conversation she stops reading my messages and never replies again. I didn‚Äôt ask her out or anything and she just stops responding in the middle of the convo. I then asked her a couple days later if she likes tacos. No response or anything. 

I‚Äôve noticed no girl ever says no. I ask them if they‚Äôre down to get together, they always say yeah sure just later and then when I try to schedule a time it always goes to ghost. 

What is the deal with that? I‚Äôm just venting right now but I cannot believe people think it‚Äôs acceptable to just stop communicating mid convo. If they just send ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù or ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt ask them again but they always say sure, just not this week. So then I have to ask again and it‚Äôs always ‚Äúsure, later‚Äù until it‚Äôs a ghost job. Is saying no really that hard?

The worst part is I‚Äôm a great conversationalist, very successful, work with music and music festivals, have travelled the world and just want someone to talk to *in person*.  I would always rather talk in person than online, but I cannot get past the text phase. I haven‚Äôt been on an actual date in what seems like forever.

5458,"HOW CAN I HELP HIM REALIZE THAT GOING TO THERAPY DOESN'T MEAN HE'S ""WEAK?""","My hubby has a systemic family anger problem---him, his brothers, his dad, his grandfather, so on and so forth and ALL of the men in the family suffer in their relationships because of it. Ironically (and sadly) the only one of the 9 kids in the dad's family who didn't have a severe anger problem, lost his wife to lung cancer---so there's a nice ""here's what happens when you aren't mad at the world"" lesson for the rest of the family.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we're dealing with a jealousy issue that I am getting some assistance for from my own therapist---hubby and I did couples together years ago but recently he's back at the ""there's nothing wrong with me, why would i go?"" stage.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to explain that his anger (specifically toward stronger/more opinionated women) is a learned behavior---literally ALL of the men in his family are like this---and that he can learn a new behavior if that's what he wants--of course he then reminds me that his Dad says ""Shrinks are for f\*gs""-- He says it was ""different"" when we were going as a couple because it wasn't just about him. Here's my subquestions to the question in the title:

1-If his dad and/or brother(s) went to therapy too--either with him in a group or seperately + individually (depending on recommendation of therapist)--what's the hive think are the chances of him opening up to it? 

2-I've explained and so have some other friends and family that therapy isn't really as torturous as so many people make it out to be--you just talk about yourself for an hour! What other points can I make that might help him realize that therapy is actually supposed to be helpful?

3-Help me understand why this is still such a thing! This is an all Irish family and they'd all rather drink and fight than talk about their feelings--with each other or anybody else---when the oldest brother died suddenly a few years ago they ALL (literally all of them) said ""I never got the chance to tell Billy that I loved him..."" and despite this lesson on our limited time in this life, these men are still paralyzed by fear when it comes to potentially emotional situations. How do I tell a manly man that the bravest and toughest thing he can do is be open about his feelings?

5492,How do I get over my feelings for a co-worker?,"So, about four months ago this girl started at the company I work for.

I thought she was attractive from day one, but being able to say the same for several of my female colleagues, it wasn't a major issue. I soon found out she was in a long-term relationship, so again it didn't really worry me too much.

This has all changed in the last few weeks, since we've been assigned to work on a couple of projects together. The more time I spend with her, the more my feelings for her have grown. While most of our conversations are professional and work-based, we get on extremely well and there have been odd moments where we've been flirty with each other, although nothing inappropriate.

Now rational me says she has a boyfriend and telling her how I feel is only going to end in tears and probably affect my job, but I can't shake off how I feel and really want to know if she feels the same way.

I think the problem is that outside of work, I never have an issue asking girls out. Even if I get a flat no, I much prefer that to keeping quiet, and if it's a no I get over it pretty quickly and move on. I've never had this happen at work before, but it's obviously a lot different to chatting to someone in a bar. I also feel like a dick because she has a boyfriend and I know how I'd feel if someone was seriously hitting on my girlfriend, but as much as I try to ignore it, I can't change the way I feel. 

So I guess the question is what should I do? How do I stop this from eating away at me? Is it even worth the risk of saying something?

5528,How can I start feeling okay about not feeling okay?,"I wrote up this comment for a recent askreddit thread but was a bit late to the party. 

I don't tell my girlfriend when I'm sad. Which is pretty often because we're long distance right now. One time I did and immediately felt like I had to apologize and say I'm sorry for being sad and tell her I know that being sad is not attractive. I wish I could just be sad and go to her for support. It's not her fault I just.. don't feel okay being not okay.

This can't be right. We should be allowed to feel not okay. And most people would probably tell me that I should just talk to my girlfriend when I'm sad and tbh, as logical as it is, I just know I probably never will for fear of the repercussions. Especially while we're long distance I feel like I have to be the strong one, and I'm just don't always feel that strong.

5537,How can I be less stressful to my fiance,"So, my fiance and I have been a little rocky for a while. He says he doesnt like to be around me anymore because he finds me very stressful. I have adhd and I've been trying to do better with house keeping and other things, but I'm a very emotional person because of my condition, so I tend to feel things more strongly than others.

Last week he was very loving and we were very happy. This week hes back to being grumpy and withdrawn. Yesterday we had a fight and he wanted to end our relationship. We are still together, but he said that I'm trying too hard to make things better and that im genuinely just a huge source of stress in his life.

He doesnt know exactly what I do that causes him stress, and he has a lot of other sources of stress in his life that make the situation worse. I know men deal with stress different than women. I want to talk things out but the more I try the more distant he becomes.

So, what I'm trying to figure out is what I can do to make things better. I want to be a source of love and support, not frustration and stress. Men who have been in this situation and gotten passed it, what are the actions that I can take to strengthen our relationship?

 We've been together for 8 years and are both really young (mid-life 20s). He has a huge financial burden on his shoulders, as well as school. I'm trying to do overtime at work to help us financially and am working to keep the house clean (clutter also stresses him). He tends to work very late most nights so he comes home already stressed and tired most weekdays.

What can I do to take some stress off of him, or what behaviors tend to hurt a relationship from a mans perspective?

I am high functioning - on the spectrum, and I already have a hard time noticing when I'm not being as emotionally attentive as I should. My bf understands and says its understandable that I'm busy, but i know he's just being polite. Our communication is great, so i know my empathy has improved (his own words).

I just want advice on things to do without it always having to be a discussion. I want it to seem that I'm not clueless for once, and that i don't need to be prompted or have him explicitly ask for things a normal person would probably think of on their own.

This took me way off guard but I tried not to let it bother me. Honestly it is her past and I know I shouldn't be bothered by this. I am not mad she has done it, I try to not to be bothered by it. She is very open with me and we are definetely exclusive in our relationship now.
But I have a tendency to be a bit jealous sexually. I don't like hearing about past sexual relations so I stear clear of it. But hearing this got in my head. 

Most of the time it doesn't bother me. I love her and do not want this to be a problem. But whenever I am alone this always comes back. I hate picturing her in this situation and it's entirely a me problem not her.

For me, I have long abandoned playing ultimate frisbee competitively. I was so into it during my high school years when it had less exposure, competing in summer leagues whenever I could. When I tried out for the actual team in college, I found that I could not keep up with all the track and basketball players who just played ultimate as a side sport.

Now, I settle for just teaching basics to some youth whenever I see them flopping their discs into the grass or participate during large group picnics. Never like I used to in the past though.

5591,How can I fix things with my girlfriend's parents when I've already messed up.,"Idk if this belongs here but i wasn't getting any help anywhere else.
So my gf and I have been dating for close to 4 months now. However at ab 2 months our parents found out. Her and I were not even sapossed to be talking but we did anyway. So her mom got mad, my mom got mad.
After that her and I started sending notes to one another. (We had a mutual friend who passed them) and that went in for I want to say a month and a half I think. But once again id even know how they found out but our parents found them. So again we got in trouble and we were forbidden to see eachother or talk to eachother.
So after that happened maybe a week after, I decided I needed to apolagize to her mother. We met at a coffee shop and I apolagized and told her I felt bad and I wanted to make this GS right so one day I could see her daughter again. She didn't really budge and said all this stuff ab how she didn't even want us to talk as friends even for maybe two years. 
I half excepted that and half didn't. I started to feel really bad because my girlfriend is going through all this alone by herself and she doesn't have anyone to talk to or ask for help with. And so  through that mutual friend I sent small verbal messages to my gf. Something like I love you so much and I miss you to death. Something small like that but also enough to keep her spirits up.

Well guys no idea how but, her mom found out. So she's in really big trouble I'm in really big trouble. Yesterday my grandpa sat me down (my dad isn't in the picture anymore) and talked to me ab the situation. He helped me understand the parents side of this and how I was wrong ( I didn't see how I was wrong before). But now I understand she's just trying to protect her daughter. I understand that I am in the wrong. I understand that it's her job as a parent. I understand that I was being really stupid before. And I was thinking I know better I'm smarter ik more. Like a dumb teenager. I want to make things right with her and her husband. I want to apolagize. And tell them that I'm sorry that they were right I want to talk to them and help them understand that I was just being a headstrong idiot.
But after the first time. I'm so scared  that she won't except my apolagy. I'm scared that she won't even want to talk. I'm scared maybe I've gone to far and maybe I'll never be able to see my Gf again when we are teens. Or lose her altogether. I love this girl more then anything with all my heart. I can't live without her. I want to do everything I can so I can see her freely again. I need help guys idk what to do or how to do it.

However I‚Äôve never quit a job before and I don‚Äôt really know how to approach it. Should I tell them I am looking for a new job or not say anything until I give my two weeks. 
If I dont say anything, will jobs I‚Äôve applied to try to check my employment by reaching out?

What can I expect when I announce that I intend to leave?

5645,My gf offered me her late brothers very expensive coat and I didn‚Äôt know how to respond to it.,"Her brother passed away not too long ago and she recently came back from bereavement.

One of the items she brought Was one of his very expensive winter coat that fits her but she says fits too much like a guys jacket (obv) but she and her family don‚Äôt want to throw it away or sell it. 

She said I should wear it. I tried to push it off saying it won‚Äôt fit me but she had me try it on and it fit. I turned it down saying a woman wearing an oversized coat is ‚Äúin‚Äù and she can pull it out occasionally. 

I am not sure if that was the right thing to do. Should I take it and store it for her since I know she‚Äôs also low on closet space. Should I take it and wear it to remind her of her bro? What‚Äôs the right move? I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells but want to be there for her.

5648,"17 M, should I be worried about my lack of female friends or acquaintances?","I‚Äôm gonna preface this by saying that I‚Äôm pretty self-confident, I know that I‚Äôm moderately attractive (at least not too ugly), I get a bit nervous around new people, but I‚Äôm very comfortable around people that I have gotten to know, and although I don‚Äôt have many close friends, I have been getting better at building those kinds of relationships. Obviously, my self-perception is biased, and probably not how everyone else sees me at all, so I might have some glaring faults that I can‚Äôt admit to myself that can be the main factor in this. 


I live in a world completely insulated from girls, a boys boarding school. Normally, this would give me some closure, it‚Äôs out of my control. However, more and more, I find that people in my year have girlfriends and vast networks of girl acquaintances. I know that I should be networking, to gain access to these circles, but honestly between my cowardice and the fact that friendship groups have been solidified to the point where I can only really be an acquaintance, I am finding it hard to meet girls the way they‚Äôre doing it. Now, I start uni next year, I‚Äôm sure that even I can find success in a coed environment, but who knows. I‚Äôm worried that this problem stems from beyond my environment, but something that‚Äôs inherently wrong with me. 

TLDR: how do I meet girls in an environment without any? And, if I fail, how should I improve to make sure that I can succeed in the future?

A few days ago tinder guy friend requests me on social media and we plan to hang out.

He could see I was pretty quiet on the way back and asked me if there was anything I wanted to talk about and I said no. He told me that if I wasn't ready that was fine with him and I ended up apologizing for not wanting to sleep with him and he didn't say anything after that.

I feel like it is similar as if I have told her I for sure would not get her a ring or organize a wedding.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eukp56/my_gf_said_she_for_sure_would_not_take_my_surname/,1580110273
5710,How can I get my girlfriend to let me walk away from a fight?,"Keeping it somewhat short, recently I've had a horrible day. To make it worse, my girlfriend did something that was completely her fault, on purpose, and it angered the hell out of me. I kept my distance from her for the day, and finally at night was preparing for bed. She kept bugging me about it, which was understandable, since I didn't tell her if I was angry, or why. I told her I was, and why, and she got angry back at me. I did nothing to her besides a bit of a cold shoulder so that I didn't explode and get angry at her. During our conversation she starts getting angry back and somehow flips our argument into me wronging her. I wanted to get some distance again, and told her I was having trouble controlling myself and that I would sleep it off. She kept pushing it, and I just had to leave. 

Guys who have had similar experiences, what do I do? Do you guys just show her your anger? Or do you walk it off. Is it normal for your girlfriend to flip the argument?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/euklrl/how_can_i_get_my_girlfriend_to_let_me_walk_away/,1580109652

5716,How can I gently persuade my partner to let go of material possessions?,"I've (28m) have lived with my partner (25f) for 4 years now. I love her to bits, but something ive noticed since day 1 is she owns alot of stuff. Before I met her I had travelled and moved around alot, I basically have never really owned much of anything. 

Anyway, 2 years ago we bought our first house. 3 bed 1 bath, we are the only people who live here. We've renovated it since we moved in and I've let her decorate the entire place, it's got a really boho- lots of indoor plants- sit on the rug and drink exotic tea sorta vibe. It looks fantastic, I love what shes done with the place, but every closet in every room is full of stuff, which naturally leaks into the living spaces. Every drawer, every cupboard is stacked full of stuff. It takes hours and hours to clean and organize because there is so much stuff. As a few examples, we have a closet full of painting equipment and blank canvases, like 50+ canvases in there, we paint maybe once per year. Theres a whole double closet full of fabrics, sewing machines, mannequins, and cosplay stuff I've never seen her use since we met. Probably 2 giant storage bins full of dairies, journals, planners, blank books etc but none have ever been used, she has 1 that she uses daily and the rest just sit there. Even stuff like bedding, we have 10 sets of sheets for our bed and 4 different quilt cover options, we only have 1 bed in the entire house, and probably 30 pairs of shoes, half of which have never been worn.

I've never made an issue of it, financially were pretty secure so I've never policed how she spends her money, it's her money. But in a practical sense we are running out of room in this house and i refuse to get a storage lockup, i feel a 3 bed house should be more than enough for 2 people? 

Every 3 months or so I go through my stuff and either donate or bin anything I dont need, she will do the same, but her donate pile is just a few things she really doesnt want. 

How can I help her declutter her life, or atleast make suggestions about letting a few things go to make our day to day lives easier and more practical? I used to ride motorcycles, but I cant see myself buying one anytime in the next 5 years so I sold all my riding gear, and I think this might be a fundamental difference in how we think. She holds on to her cosplay stuff incase she wants to make another outfit one day, despite not making one in 6 years. 

Another option I've considered is hiring a cleaner, which I'm not against if that's what the advice suggests but I've voiced this before and my partner didnt like the idea of someone else cleaning up our own mess and I kinda feel the same. I also dont think shes a hoarder, shes just a creative person who likes having her resources always available, even if they wont be used in the foreseeable future.

Throughout the night I had been mingling with this one girl bc she was pretty cool and we played a few games of cup pong together so we kicked it off. I didn't look at her as a girl I would try to pipe down bc to me she was just a new acquaintance. But then, the drinks started kicking in... She was dancing on me and things started escalating throughout the night and eventually she took me to one of the rooms in the house to go fuck. At that point, I was pretty damn recked already and wasn't really conscious of who I was fucking. Now, a day later I am reminiscing on yesterday's events and don't know how to feel about it. I texted her to make sure she was alright and she sounded like she wanted to go for some extra rounds.

She asked what was wrong but I told her I usually don‚Äôt like to fuck on the first date and I felt as if we should wait a bit more. She bought it and I internally let out the biggest sigh of relief I ever have in my life.

5799,"Men of Reddit, I need your advice to see if I was being dramatic or not.","So, let me get some groundwork out of the way:

I'm 22 y/o, I've been working at a factory for around 8 months. In this factory, my position is with a small group of co-workers (3-4 daily), most of these people have been with me from the start.  Outside of that, I'm part of a group of friends (but I'm really more like a ""third wheel"" if anything).

**Okay, here's how it starts:**

So, last week I was working at my job, and my ""then"" supervisor told me that I was lying about the position I worked at and that I needed to return to my field. So, turns out my records were messed up and it showed worked in a lower part of the job than I did. So listen, last month the factory asked me several times to do 'volunteer help' (i.e work in a different part of the factory outside of your usual) for the holidays, for about four weeks. It think what happened was that I volunteered there so many times atp, that they thought I worked there permanently. So, they changed my records.

After that happened, I obviously went to the front desk to sort the situation. They said they'll look at my history and take care of it. Cool. 

Next week passes, it's still not fixed. So my supervisor comes up and tells me why I'm here and I should be working at the other place. I tell her that I've always here and that they're fixing the situation right now. She tells me to provide proof (since my records weren't fixed, I couldn't), otherwise I would get in trouble for being off-task. I tell my co-workers to vouch for me since they've been with me since the start. They didn't say anything AT ALL, because again...no records, and they didn't want to get in trouble.

So, I spent the rest of the shift working in the wrong position and then spent next SIX hours trying to prove my case, otherwise I could lose my job. I quit my job yesterday and am already working at a different building (same business however).

So, essentially I felt I got punished for something that was completely their fault.

**AFTERWARDS:**

I drive home and I find out I'm out of gas, there's one gas station nearby and I don't have any change. I can't ask any of my family or friends for help, because they're broke too. I ask the people at the gas stalls for help, but they said no. I ask the people inside the store for help, but they kick me out. I call one of my close friends for help cause I know he's gets paid that day, but he didn't even respond. He does that every time I need help. So, I spend the next hour trying to find lose change (it was an open plain, no one cared) to exchange for gas money. I eventually find $1.80 worth of change, which is literally just enough to get to my house. So, I roll out.

FURTHERMORE:

So, I'm pissed about how my day went and I wanted to talk one of my friends about it. I call him and he says he's sleeping. I tell I'll call him later since he's sleeping and I won't bother him, and he angrily responds with 'what do you want?'

I explain to him my situation, involving leaving my job, and the stuff at the gas station. And he just says, ""is that all you called me for?"". ""What do you hope to accomplish?"" I respond by saying, ""I don't want to accomplish anything. I just want you to listen"". I ask him what's wrong with that and he says that he doesn't like that I called him just to chat and that I should only call him ""for important things"". Not just to see ""how my day was"". I tell him fine and to just go back to bed. He hangs up on me.

I lost my MIND after that. Flailing my arms, banging my head on the ground, shouting at the world. I went insane, because I felt like at that moment, NO ONE had my back.

Here's a little bit of context for my question but you don't have to read that, you can just answer the question in general. 

I am now coming to the end of a two year fight with vaginislus, which used to prevent me from having any penetrative sex. This has not stopped me from having a thrilling and inventive sex life with my partners, but I always feel like what I am doing is not as good as it should be. For example, I like giving head but I can't (and don't want to) deepthroat. Or, whether it is a blowjob or handjob, even if the guy is enjoying himself I can't really tell if what he's feeling is kind of generic pleasure or something really good. And I know the easiest way to know is to ask but I find it also really un-sexy to do a debriefing everything that happens in bed everytime. Also I know I can now have sex with penetration but I also know it takes a lot of time for me to ""let it in"" because my muscle just need time to relax. And although I have been sexually active for 2/3 years now, penetration is new for me and I fear that I'm going to be ""boring"" to the next guy I have sex with because of all of that stuff....
I know that is quite a problem about my own confidence as well, but with one of my ex boyfriends, I felt like we had a great, inventive and thrilling  sex life and he always said he had no problem with me having vaginismus, that is was okay, but when we broke up he told me about how frustrated and unhappy I made him because of that illness.

5843,How do you deal with extreme body envy?,"Hey all. This is a serious question, so if you answer, please be respectful. I also really hope this is an appropriate subreddit to ask this in.

I realize now just how awkward of a post this is, how taboo it is, etc. I don't believe myself to be homosexual. However, I have come to terms with myself on something: I have a problem with constantly looking at pictures of men that are in great shape, and are young. I myself am young, and in decent shape, but I covet those with muscular physiques. Not because I want have sex with them, but because I want to almost *be* them in, a sense. It's gotten out of control; starting with just thoughts of insecurity, losing focus at the gym when someone with a desirable size is nearby, masturbating to videos and images of muscle worship, and questioning if I have bigorexia or some kind of depression. I think I am attracted to the idea of being a better version of myself. Someone who is more successful, and the big-man in the room. And my biggest takeaway, is that I think this is severely hurting me in the dating field because I am so obsessive over myself, that I constantly am fighting the battle of: ""how can I love someone else if I don't love myself"".

Has anyone suffered from this, to this degree? Am I in a minority? Is this a mental health issue? I realize that yeah, sure, everyone wishes they looked a little better, and self-image is a challenge for men and women alike.

5846,Can you really just be friends with a coworker?,"Me [27F] and my boyfriend [30M] have been dating for four years. 
Recently he bought a house that had a guest house attached so that we could turn it into an Airbnb and make a profit. Come to find out he asked one of his female (our age or younger)!coworkers that he has mentioned to me in conversation before but I never really paid any attention to it. He went shopping with her and lied to my face about it. He said he went alone. When the same night was my company work party and he didn‚Äôt come. Anyway. She kept shopping on various days without him and texting him and sending him pictures of things she liked and thought he should buy. He showed them to me and asked my opinion, that was when I started noticing her in our conversations more. 

Then I started to become suspicious after he lied to me about going shopping with her. I went through his phone. (I know, not proud). He had a random picture of her at a construction site (their job) eating alone with a sandwich on his phone(?)She is an instagram ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù and posts half naked pictures of herself and has thousands of followers, he started liking every one of her pictures. Then, she started a website where her followers pay her for content. He is subscribing for $5 a month. When asked about it he just stated that he is supporting his friend and all his coworkers are doing it and she is paying them back. 

Am I reading too much into this? He already lied to me. I can‚Äôt prove that he cheated. But isn‚Äôt it all a little much? Would you do all of this for a coworker?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eufk05/can_you_really_just_be_friends_with_a_coworker/,1580083586

Most/all of my sexual conversations started out on some type of app. Of all the people I was sexually interested in, I‚Äôm talking to no one long term.

5871,My brother is a victim of domestic abuse. What can I do?,"My brother is recently married too a woman who is not very nice at all. She's very unpleasant and argumentative as well as negative and derogatory towards pretty much everyone.

But thats not the worst of it and if it was I wouldn't be making this post.

She abuses my brother verbally and emotionally. She is constantly yelling at him and putting him down. When I say constantly I mean CONSTANTLY, she has no shame about it, she will yell in public, at the dinner table and in front of me, my mom and my sister.

But that is still not the worst. She financially abuses him as well. All of his paycheck goes directly to her and she only gives him a small allowance. She does this for her own gain, but also to control his actions as he is only allowed to spend what she let's him spend.

His spending money is virtually nothing and he often has to ask my mom to buy him things, like entrance fees when we go to do things, restaurants and on one occasion even clothes... All this from a man who has a full time job and makes ‚Ç¨40k per year.

But what gets me the most is his attitude to it... He doesn't believe there is anything wrong.

My brother has had a troubled past. He has struggled with his career, with depression and with alcohol and he has very low self esteem. He says he doesn't care about her yelling because he does make mistakes and he doesn't care about the money because he doesn't know how to handle money himself.

But I know my brother. He is beaten down and is unhappy and afraid to express himself. He shakes like a cowering dog at the first sign of conflict... It is very disheartening to see that in your older brother.

I have been objecting lately and the wife has pretty much removed herself and my brother from the family as a result. We only get to see him very rarely.

5882,Straight guys: What is the dating etiquette for informing a man about your period?,"Okay this sounds oddly specific, but since it‚Äôs a situation that me (f22) and my girlfriends frequently have been in and  discussed, I thought this might be the place to get some answers. 

The situation is as follows: you‚Äôre dating a guy in the casual way that seems so common nowadays,meaning that you started by hooking up. Now you‚Äôre doing it frequently. It has not yet been established if you‚Äôre headed towards more than sex, but sometimes you‚Äôll do other things like watch a movie, cook some food, get a drink at your place etc. Sex always happens, but when you make plans, you do it to see each other and you always plan an activity. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhey wanna hook up‚Äù- type of arrangement although you always end up in bed. Maybe you hope it will lead to something more. So what do you do, when you have a date planned and you‚Äôll be on your period? 

Is there some kind of etiquette to whether you need to ‚Äúwarn‚Äù the guy beforehand that it is that time of the month, so he knows sex might not happen or there‚Äôll be blood involved?
My friends and I always feel awkward bringing it up on text and especially if you like them, you don‚Äôt want to assume the sole purpose of the date is to hook up. We know not having sex is not the end of the world, but also don‚Äôt want the guy to show up expecting it and be disappointed. 

Since this keeps happening to us (maybe cause we bleed every month lol), it‚Äôd be really nice to hear some male thoughts on what‚Äôs the best way to handle this and if there‚Äôs some sort of period-informing social etiquette that we‚Äôre missing out on.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eudyh4/straight_guys_what_is_the_dating_etiquette_for/,1580076934
