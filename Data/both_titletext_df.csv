60,How can I better attract and retain female staff?,"I work in IT for a large, well known bank that is generally perceived as an unfashionable place to work. By ""unfashionable"" I mean that while the work environment is generally friendly, it's not perceived as an exciting company to work like say a fintech or start-up might be.  The majority of our staff are married men over 40 and our technology and processes are not leading edge.

Like most companies our size, we have a diversity target, however I am having a very hard time attracting or retaining female talent to our organisation.  Typically for each job vacancy I get about 20 male applications for every female one.  The female applications are also not usually very good.  I've tried developing existing female staff however they almost always leave to more exciting companies when they are able to.

Two things I can't do, because they are not legal in my country are:
a) I can't specify a desired gender when recruiting, and
b) I can't pay people more because of gender

Our maternity leave policies are already very good compared to other companies and in any case it's not within my power to change them.

66,Supporting my girlfriend after she took Plan B,"\*tldr; condom slipped off, took plan b, I want to support her without doing too much; how would you want your bf to treat you when you took plan b\* 

Earlier this week, my girlfriend \[22\] and I \[22\] had sex where the condom slipped off and I came inside of her before either of us realized what had happened. We were both in shock, especially because something like this had never happened to us before, and it felt like a blip in an otherwise responsible way we usually are with each other. After getting over the initial shock, we drove to CVS and got Plan B, where she took it maybe an hour or two after we initially had sex. 

The situation itself, we both understand, is just an unfortunate mistake that neither of us had intention of happening. Despite us recognizing that it was an accident, my girlfriend voiced how incredibly unlucky she had felt with sex in her life -- she's had a complicated history with potentially close sexual assaults and it's been a mental barrier shes had to overcome as she gets more intimate and vulnerable in our relationship. Because of this pretext and her view on sex as a highly vulnerable experience, it was also our first time having sex. 

Now it has been a couple days since the initial incident and things are starting to feel slightly less like a whirlwind. After she took Plan B, that night we wanted to be with each other and help each other cope through the initial wave of what had just happened. I came home around midnight as we decided having some space to individually process would be good. The following day, she experienced pretty heavy exhaustion as well as some cramps and nausea. I came over and made her some dinner while we talked about how we felt and what was on our mind. She expressed that she knows that she usually bottles things up and has a hard time externally processing but thanked me for encouraging her to externally process how she feels. She explained that she will do her best to explain how she feels as the feelings come up but she might have days where she will need to do her processing on her own.

The days have definitely been exhausting to say the least and I am reminded of it regularly as we work in the same office (thankfully not the same department). How do I support my girlfriend without doing ""too much""? I know if I do too much she will close off and won't want to talk, yet I want to show her I am still thinking about it as I know it's still affecting her body and her mentality pretty heavily. Women that I've spoken too in my life say to just be supportive but know when to back off, but I'd like to better understand where is the point to back off.

Funny thing is, she’s completely oblivious to certain aspects - mostly because there’s no reason for her to care, it just is what it is to her. I have to ask very specific questions to get even the slightest insight as to what’s going on in her head.

Having this weight on my body has been an uncomfortable adjustment. I have always been very thin. I’m 5’8” so I’m still very lean and overall just look, well, healthy. Lol. But still.

I definitely inherited my dads big stomach, and my moms behind. These are the areas that have seen the biggest change since gaining the weight, the problem now is that I’m battling with stretch marks.

Obviously there is nothing wrong with stretch marks, I think they’re the cutest thing on my girlfriend. For some reason, though, seeing them on my own butt and stomach has brought back some really troubling body image issues. I now feel like I need to drop all of this weight, etc. thinking about them just sends me into a panic.

Are there any remedies that anybody out there swears by? The marks aren’t big or very dark, but with my history of body dysmorphia and anorexia I would really appreciate any advice I can get.

172,Normal for a guy to not last long when giving him head?,"
I made out on a bit of a whim with someone I share a mutual attraction with who is a few years older than I am and based on my impression, has far more sexual experience than I do. To cut to the chase, we began to make out, one thing led to another and again, I don't have much experience but what I love most about getting sexually intimate with someone is to please them and to try and convey my desire for them by making them feel like they are on top of the world with me. One thing led to another and my excitement to pleasure him lead me to unzipping his pants and I haven't given many BJ's in my life but 10 seconds in he's moaning away and shares he could cum any moment and around 5 seconds after that, came in my mouth (which I didn't mind at all and was more than happy to swallow). Right after, he pulled my face up, said he wouldn't mind tasting himself if that meant he could kiss me more.

Although I'm sure he enjoyed it in some sense, is it normal for someone to cum in 15 seconds?! I could care less if he came quickly (I am a little flattered he did - but should I be? Lol). Guess I am just worried I didn't do a good job. I was fully expecting to get to work for at least 2-5 minutes, especially for someone (who in my understanding) has dealt with some pretty experienced females beforehand that most likely have better skills than I do so it caught me by surprise I guess, and has my questioning myself lol.

Do guys enjoy it quick? Is there anything I could have done to elongate this BJ to have made it more enjoyable for him? Any advice to calm my overthinking mind?!",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/esqdzv/normal_for_a_guy_to_not_last_long_when_giving_him/,1579769020

Last week when she spent the night I asked her if she considered taking the relationship further than just making out. She said that she had thought about it but she was kinda raised to be opposed to premarital sex and that she isn't necessarily going to wait until marriage but she still didn't think she was ready and I assured her that I was fine with waiting. I honestly am fine with waiting I really care about her and I completely understand that she isn't ready. I was just wondering if it is something that I should bring up again and if so how long should I wait? Or should I just wait until she mentions it to me.

204,How do you feel about straight men and male partners into women's fashion?,"I grew up with unfashionable parents and a dad who didn't care at all. He just has a way about him where he can sort of make anything work even if it was obviously stupid, it look normal on him and people would gravitate toward him anyway. I did not inherit this quality despite looking like basically his double so often just looked like crap due to adopting his mentality and also being a gamer.  


Past 3 years or so, I have changed a LOT and rarely game and started caring about my appearance a lot and gotten VERY good at clothes shopping and styling. I don't follow trends and dress for myself and noticed that I was getting WAY more female attention than I ever have in my life. It's common sense that good appearance helps but I didn't realize how drastic it was in my case.  


To fast forward, it got to a point where I also started caring more about a more stylish type of woman (but not anyone that comes off as high maintenance) and it became clear to me that, women's fashion is FAR superior to men's! There are endless options and now I truly understand the, ""shop til you drop"" reference because you can NEVER have enough amazing items as a woman!  


I started to learn what I personally liked on various different types of women (acrylic nails, handbags, heels, boots, denim, leather, jackets and coats are big deals for me in everyday wear) and spent a lot of time googling, youtubing and browsing women's sections of clothing websites or full on women's websites as well as hair and makeup. Basically anything fashionable that pertains to women I've done some intensive research on at this point. Skin care in particular has been mindblowing to learn and actually benefits me. Turns out, more men NEED to indulge in it, period.  


As such, I know more about women's fashion than many women do and have even helped some female friends and women at work with their outfits, styling, nails and makeup ideas. In fact, there was a funny situation where I was ""educating"" some female co workers on acrylic nail options and our very openly gay coworker gasped in disbelief that I knew what I did claiming he couldn't match my knowledge in nails or women's fashion despite knowing his stuff as well haha.  


I even managed to get free physical subscriptions to Marie Claire (feels like Ellie lite and lower quality phys), Elli (amazing magazine) and Harper's Bazaar (my favorite and amazingly put together with gorgeous shots) and am looking into Vogue magazine. I have been single (by choice) for the past 8 months since I've been busy making huge life making decisions but fashion has become my hobbyist passion that has consumed me.   


I want to try going to runway shows in NYC (I live in Boston) and despite having zero intention of wearing any women's items ever, have seen bags and shoes I thought were so nice, that they would be amazing to have as a collector (I used to collect games and still do collect art books so not new territory for me).  


I am DEFINITELY the person to encourage bad shopping habits when it comes to this stuff haha. Which got me thinking, when I am ready to start dating again, I'm clearly going to want someone reasonably into this stuff. While I have zero intention of controlling what anyone wears, I do find the idea of shopping with them, suggesting ideas and taking on a stylist role at times exciting.   


Also, while I never want to be anyone's sugar daddy, I have no problem buying things for them solely because I want to but ""smartly"" and not in a way where they can manipulate me into getting them things. Basically, they'd never know when or why and any attempt to form a pattern or system to ensure it would be futile.

225,Is this considered relationship?,"So I had a crush on this guy starting from 2015. We exchanged numbers but I never really wanted to go more than friends. One evening he asked me if I wanted to hang out the next day. So I said sure, and the next day he took me to his house. He got so touchy and started touch my body all over. Next thing, he started to pull my shirt and pants off and wanted to have sex. I didn't want to but he started controlling me to not stop. Every time, I went to his place he asked me to get naked to have sex. This routine started to continue until 2018. So one day I caught his ex gf at his place and I got angry because I really thought he was cheating on me. I went home angry and wanted to cry. I texted him the next day, is she really your gf? are you really cheating on me? and he said no, she's not my gf and I'm not cheating on you. On Sept 11 I texted him. somehow his ex gf copied my number and remember it on her phone. She started to text me saying how stupid I was to believe his lies since he is a pyschological manipulative liar, telling me she's his gf! not his ex gf! I started believing her side because she sent me a picture. I got hurt even more and stopped talking to him.

 About a year ago he hid an app from me and had pictures from my sisters social media and pictures of me without me or her knowing and was jacking off to them along with social media pictures of others I know. In the first year we were dating he used to get upset at me if I didn't ""finish"" duringsex. He doesn't do this anymore but he has made me feel so worthless and sad. I don't know why I stuck with him but I did. 


This year he has been pretty great until I found some things from a couple years ago on his phone including flirting with a girl in a group chat. I don't know if I can do better or not but he is also perfect in every way other that things like this. He is my first love so I think that is why this choice is harder as well and I know I'm not perfect either. I interrogate him alot over things and have major trust issues. We also live together and own a cat together. I don't know what to do. 


We have had so many great memories from this relationship and are fairly great now but I'm having trouble with the past. Do you think I can work past this or no?

263,Is a pleasant man not attractive? Please also inform if me asking this question makes entitled.,"I live in Europe where English is foreign language. So, I've recently been told by my tandem partner that she chose to be my language partner out of many other people because she found me very pleasant. We now meet ever weekend and generally have fun time. 

I also have another lady tandem partner. It seems women don't mind being my tandem partners as every time I asked any lady to practice language exchange, they said yes. Apparently women don't hate me, because I actually do have many female friends, I think more than male ones. I have also been told I'm charming, by people of many different types.

All these opinions I acquired, not because I asked them their opinion about me, but because I do travel a lot and I meet loads of strangers and I love chatting to people, hearing their stories and experiences and we laugh and sometimes I end up hearing these comments.

But after all these interactions, I never found love in my 32 years of life. I have never had a nice woman respond to my advances positively, let alone approach me. Now, I'm a bit confused. I'm not a shy man. I don't think I'm boring either, as apart from traveling I do have many other hobbies like singing, cooking, reading, learning languages, history  etc. I have a decent job in one of the largest companies in the world, so I guess I'm not stupid.

I'm not fat. I try to work out several days per week. I'm definitely short, 160cm (5'3""). Okay, I don't have a lot of muscle showing up because I love eating, so my diet isn't perfect, but I only weigh 60-61 Kg. 

So, if women find me pleasant, what could be the turn off? Is it my lack of height? Or is it because I kinda look brown and young, South Asian or Latin (many strangers thought I'm Mexican) and not really mature, hot, manly looking man, like many Arab, Black and white guys look?

265,Relocation and Job Change Advice,"I'm in a tough spot here.  I live in the city that I live in because of my boyfriend's job.  I had a hard time finding a job that I liked in this area so a little over 3 years ago I started my own business instead.  Ultimately I am not happy in my relationship, and I hate the city that I live in, but that is a lot of stuff to change at once.  I'm looking for feedback from women who have done what I am wanting to do- move 6 hours away, and leave almost everything behind.  I have to get a new job because I will lose all of my clients when I move, and need to make sure I can pay my bills while I get reestablished, so how does one job search from afar like this?  And how does one find a safe place to live from afar?  I have no problem with getting a roommate, but how do I find a good one?  How do I prioritize all of the things that I need to do?  And what do I do about my relationship?  I'm concerned that if I tell him how I feel, he will kick me out immediately, so I feel like I should have all of my ducks in a row first because I have no family that I can stay with.

I work in a job where I have all kind of people in and out, most of them I don’t remember their faces or names. But the other day I met a woman that was older (early 50’s; I’m early 20’s) and I was extremely taken with her. Absolutely smitten. But now I’m not sure how to reach out and see if maybe there might be something there. I have never been really good with things like this because I let my anxiety get ahead of me. 

But we shared some good banter, back and forth. But it’s been several days and I want to reach out, but I’m not sure how I should go about it. Would anyone happen to have any suggestions to best approach this situation?",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/eskg5a/theres_an_older_woman/,1579736725

 I believe women need spaces where biological (two x chromosome) females can be around each other. Women's shelters and women's sports teams are just a few examples of what I'm referring to. These are places where woman deserve the right to be around each other and NOT with bio men who label themselves as trans or gay. I understand some women are comfortable with this but; you have to take into consideration that not every female is comfortable with sharing/competing/working with bio men 24/7. With that being said, I am dumbfounded, that a lot of women I bring this up to think I'm being transphobic. I thoroughly believe women are shaming themselves into accepting trans or gay men as one of us when that's setting women back and giving bio men (gay, trans or straight) a right to control women by limited our power, our right to an opinion and our right to say no. We should be able to question, doubt and speak up against whatever is in front of us. When these gay men or transwomen use terms such as ""hatred"" or ""bigotry"" as a response, that's a form of manipulation and dismissal which gives the male leverage and control. Once again, I don't have a problem with gay or transgender women, I just want them to respect a bio woman's decision and acknowledge that not all females are okay with you being in our spaces for various reasons.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/esjw5e/i_feel_that_biological_women/,1579734325

288,"Started living together and soon after a relationship with my bestfriend, but feels like the wrong decision","So, a bit of background story: I left home because my relationship with my family was abusive. I left in a hurry and my (23f) bestfriend (27m) stayed by my side the entire time and helped me with everything. After 2 years of being just friends we started going out sometimes, and had become real close, whilst still being just friends. He knows everything about me, including that I didn't yet feel ready to be with no one romantically. Anyway, he offered me his home and we started living together. Some days later we were talking about our relationship and I casually said we looked like we were lovers. Right after he asked me to be his girlfriend. While super unsure, I said yes. I also knew he liked me and just felt like I couldn't decline it, while convincing myself that I can't keep running away forever from having a relationship. I am going through major changes in my life and wanted to spin it 180. But the days have gone by (about 25 days) and my body keeps telling me that this isn't what I want. That I don't like him this way. I've been trying to wrap my mind around it and just start loving him already, but I can't. I feel bad and guilty, he's a wonderful man and if I had to choose the characteristics I'd want in a guy, he has it. But I can't make up feelings. I've tried talking to him about it, but couldn't say the exact words. He asked me ""do you want to break up, then?"", and I just couldn't say it. I said no, because I don't want him to be out of my life, he is real important to me. I always put others feelings before mine and hurting him feels unbearable. We agreed that we should try more, that I must learn to trust and be open, that I can't run away forever. But I don't know, I really want to be with him but my mind and body keeps telling me I'm not ready. I know he senses I'm feeling bad. I am. And I don't know what to do. I just didn't want to lose him. I wish I had said ""no, I'm not ready yet, I don't feel this way"", but I didn't. And now I'm super lost. I thought I wanted it and thought I could make my mind around, but it doesn't look like it. Please, help.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/esjeoc/started_living_together_and_soon_after_a/,1579732169

353,Is this going anywhere do you think?,"I met this girl online a couple of weeks ago. We texted for about a week and I had asked her to hang out but she said she was busy. Then one day she randomly said to come over her house so I was like alright yeah I'll come over. 

So I went there and we went to a coffee shop and chatted and laughed and it seemed like it was goin pretty good. Then we went back to her place and we watched a horror movie. We layed on her bed and she rested her head on me. Then about half way through the movie I said somethin that made her laugh and she kissed me. 

Then when the movie was over I left and on the way out she went to hug me but I kissed her. 
The next day I texted her like ""hey I had fun yesterday. If you ever want to come to my place I can pick you up if you want I'm cool with that"" because she doesn't have a car. 

Then she texted me back like ""hey I'm glad you had fun, I had fun too. Thanks for coming all the way here. I'd like to come to your place sometime but I'm about to get really busy so I don't know my schedule"" She was about to start school again the next day. 

Then I was like ""ok that's cool we'll figure it out."" Then I told her about this cool Mexican restaurant near my house but she never texted back. I'm startin to think she kinda just wanted to fuck but I didn't do that because I didnt feel like having more emotionless sex on a first date. I thought she was mad cool though and funny.

356,Period experiences while on Mirena?,"I’m 23F and I have the Mirena IUD. I got it placed in April of last year and since I’ve had it, I’ve had really short periods with light bleeding that only require a regular pantyliner. My periods always last like 2-3 days but I’ve noticed my past few period have been lasting longer and are heavier. I’m not sure if I should be concerned or if it’s a sign that maybe the Mirena has moved or isn’t as effective anymore? I’m experiencing really bad cramps today and I haven’t felt any cramps for about 4 years. Before the Mirena, I had the Nexplanon arm implant and my periods were very light and almost non existent then as well.  I’ve already taken Tylenol for the pain. When I showered this morning I felt around for the strings and at first I was scared because I couldn’t find them but after trying for a few seconds I found them, they seemed shorter or farther up than usual. Has anyone else seen experienced a change in there periods while on this birth control? 

TLDR: I know the Mirena can cause periods to be irregular but my periods have always been sort of regular and consistent with both this IUD, and the implant I had in the past. Also experiencing painful cramps, which I haven’t had in years. Should I be concerned or is it normal?",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/esgqed/period_experiences_while_on_mirena/,1579720927

367,Concerned about possible ectopic pregnancy,"Hello! I'm a 28F in Canada. So I started having really emotional outbursts a while ago, always the week before my period. I was way more emotional than usual, and put it off as PMS. This continued so I went to the doctor and they diagnosed me with PMDD and I'm currently trying my first set of sertraline which I only take during my luteal phase of my cycle. 

I'm not unfamiliar with antidepressants, as I was on some for several years, but I started having nausea in the mornings and assumed it was from the meds that I took with dinner the night before. The nausea is bad enough that I don't eat until 4 or 5 pm when it passes. 

Now to this morning, I had sex with my boyfriend and it hurt, which NEVER happens for us. No biggie, I go on with my day, still nauseous. Now I have shooting sharp left pelvic pain and back pain, and I'm spotting. I usually don't spot and am very diligent following my period. 

I'm still at work and haven't taken a pregnancy test but I'm worried. Looking for some advice! I do have an IUD, if that's pertinent information.

I have a great guy in front of me. We have SO much in common. Similar views on important things ie. marriage, kids, politics...I almost feel like if soulmates were real, he'd be it. We just click and it sooo sooo easy and fulfilling.

But then I have days where I resort to my cave. I don't think I can possibly give everything the way I did before. I put everything out there when it came to my ex and I just don't think I can ever do that again for someone, as bad as that sounds. And he is SOO deserving of my time, and effort and love. He is patient, kind, loving and he is always there. He has so many great qualities that my ex didn't even have. It just doesn't feel the same and I feel like I will always be chasing that feeling I once got and until I get that again I won't give my all.

I'm currently single and don't have sex regularly...maybe once every two to three months. However any time I do I get incredibly bloated afterwards. I'm talking about vaginal Sex here, no anal stuff involved. The blurting gets so bad my stomach swells up like a hot air ballon and I can sometimes barely breathe. It usually hurts a lot all night long, I get terrible cramps and the urge to...get rid of the air. I'm talking about staying at my date's place and not being able to sleep at all because I am holding in farts. It's terrible. I always go to the toilet after sex to prevent infections and shower. Sometimes some air will come out but usually the blurting process takes at least half an hour but will then last all night. So I get up 5 to 6 times at night to let it rip (extremely loudly) in the bathroom because god forbid the guy would hear it. But last time I couldn't hold it in because my cramps were so intense and it slipped out while I was pretending to be asleep.  This situation is driving me craaaaaazy. It's embarrassing, gross and painful and I don't know what to do. Does anyone else have this problem? Anyone know what to do about it?

The dr ordered me to get a colposcopy which was scheduled for the next fortnight but I cant afford it private. I'm trying to get put onto the public wait list. 

Anyway, I am really concerned as I've never had anyone else who has had abnormal cells for as long as I have. Is there anyone here who has and then theyve cleared?

520,Was this consensual or am I just stupid??,"Okay so look. I just recently had sex for the first time as an 18yr old woman. I was very excited and joyed to have had sex. I shared this information with some people at my job that I work with Bc we are a “family” like establishment and (again) I was very excited and felt the need to tell people. (Bad choice, yes Ik)
SO there is this one particular co worker which I hadn’t been close to but we were always cool. Jokes and laughs and whatnot’s, nothing flirty nothing serious. In the past before all of this he wanted to talk to me by asking for my number. He’s way older than me w child so No I was not attracted/interested in him. ofc I told him I wasn’t interested. We continued to be cool as stated above. I want to let it be known that I wasn’t the person to tell him I recently just had sex for the first time. It was another co worker.
It becomes topic of the fucking day. And he (along w others)  won’t stop making misogynistic jokes. I become frustrated and even a little pissed off but since they were “joking” I was expected to just laugh along w them.
Anyways fast forward a couple weeks and I’m working with this same co worker. Me, him, and a few other co workers were all discussing relationships and sex. I was inquiring about some advice in regards to how I should go about certain things. All of sudden he starts bragging on how good he gives head. Blah blah blah. One then asks me if I ever received head before. To which I responded no Bc I hadn’t. So he (as well as the manager on duty ) insists he be the first person to give me head Bc he Bc was so good. 
Yes it was good yes it was consensual. He even told me “we don’t have to do this if you don’t want to”
Next shift we worked together he asked if I wanted head again after work. Ofc I said yes. HOWEVER as we are walking to my car he asks “ so what all we about to do?” I say “the same thing as last time” which was get some head and go home. 
Second time around I was very unimpressed and uncomfortable (no I didn’t cum). I believe I was not enjoying myself because I was not attracted to him in any way, shape, or form. (I called it experimenting.) anyways the act is coming to an end and I begin to raise up to start putting on my bottoms and he goes “what are doing” I’m clearly confused so I look at him like “wtf you mean “ 
I don’t remember much after that. All I remember is him unbuckling his pants and e whipping his d*ck out. as I watched this before my eyes I felt as though I was in shock. Next thing Ik I was having very uncomfortable, unenjoyable, disgusting, non pleasurable sex. I drove home in turmoil. 
Since then I haven’t been able to put a tampon inside. I go back and forth with myself trying to figure out if it’s my fault Bc I didn’t say verbally say “no” or “stop” or “I don’t want to do this” but never agreed to it either. All in all I kind of hate myself for allowing this to happen to me.

I serve weddings, banquets, etc. Lately, it seems about every other shift, I have people commenting how I look “exactly like Robert Pattinson.” Keep in mind I didn’t even know what he looked like (since he did that twilight series when I was 10).

At first I shrugged it off. But literally EVERYONE in their right mind kept telling me I looked like him...

... so one day I finally looked him up and yes, I’ll admit, it’s uncanny. Even my hairstyle is exactly the same as his. Lips, jaw, smile. We also have the same height, 5 o’clock shadow. It’s almost as if we were separated at birth (even though I’m 19 and he’s 30 something).

Anyhow, here is my question:

- women, how attractive is he to you/what is his reputation?

- if you think he doesn’t look good/have good style (hair, etc), do you think I should switch it up? I haven’t switched my hair style in years.

I’m usually not super self conscious, but lately I’ve been messing with different hairstyles trying to not look like him as stupid as that sounds, just to raid off “you look like him” comments (again, don’t know if it’s good or bad).

593,"First visit to the OBGYN, single father","Hey folks, this is probably done to death but I'd appreciate anyone who chimes in. I'm youngest of 3 boys and I'm a bit lost on some aspects of raising a girl. My 12yo had her first menstrual cycle a few months back. I asked my ex, but she is of the mind that an OB should only be necessary after our daughter has sex for the first time. FWIW my ex-wife had a hysterectomy at 23 and hasn't been back to  the doctor a lot since. This delay for our girl strikes me as way off so I'm looking for some other opinions (and hell, I guess things I haven't thought of). When should I take her? What questions should I ask or suggest my daughter ask him in private?

707,If a woman makes a reaching effort to touch you in conversation does that mean they are trying to convey a message?,"Allow me to explain a little bit more. 

There's this co-worker I am a little smitten with. I also have a bad history in misinterpreting female attention, so usually I just don't go out of my way to interact with women. 

But this woman, even when I walk by her and ignore her, seems to make an effort to say hello. From far away I always catch her following me with her eyes, tho I know this doesn't really mean anything. 

The defining moment was when I came in on my day off and bought something. This is retail, so she was up at the registers. I walked to a register and didn't really make an effort to get her attention. She seemed busy. But our eyes caught in the checkout cam.

So get this. She approaches and says hey. We start talking and she asks me how I'm doing and gives me an arm touch on the shoulder. But this arm touch required her to reach and stretch a bit to do. In addition her hand took the shape ones hand takes when they are sprinkling spices over a classy steak. You know, that fingers pinched together action. 

I must sound like an insane person, but I am reading into this really hard. It's been five years since I've been in a relationship and against my fear of getting hurt and the what-ifs I'm actually thinking about asking if she wants to chill sometime. 

I just need to know what the damn arm touch meant. I mean, aren't women usually careful about giving attention to men? Wouldn't want the guy you were trying to be nice to thinking that you're into him, right?

776,How to get over the pressure of a “life timeline”?,"I’ve always had a timeline for my life, and I’m sure many women do. There are certain societal expectations that make it very difficult for me to ignore. As a result, I feel like I’m rushing through life, anxious to get to the next step “in time.”

I’ll be specific:

I’m 26. I just bought my first house with my boyfriend, despite family pressure (mostly from his side) to get engaged/get married. We decided to save all of our money and buy/renovate our dream home and put off a wedding (which run $25k+ seemingly at minimum where I live—my friends’ extremely average weddings both cost $40,000+).

However, now that we bought the house and JUST started renovations, I’m feeling the panic creep up. We always said we’d give ourselves a year to do the reno before we move in because we don’t want to take out loans (we live at home and no one is kicking us out). But now that it’s here I’m like, “Oh god, that means I’ll be almost 28. Then we have to plan a wedding which means I’ll be at least 29 when I get married. And then what, I have to pop out a kid right away to meet my goal of 30?”

It’s silly. All because I don’t want to be an “old” mom and I’m scared of potential fertility issues, etc etc. Which I guess are valid concerns, but still. I want to just enjoy my NOW. What we just did is a big deal, and it feels like I’m ignoring it because I’m constantly focused on the next thing on my checklist.

842,Is this girl interested and should I do anything?,"I met this girl in a school related group around the middle of last year. I went back a couple of times mostly for a chance to get to talk to her one on one. It never really happened. We've had very slight interactions, and it seems like she'll always make some very short comment to me if nothing else. I stopped going to the group because a certain person there made me uncomfortable, and I don't want to go back because of them.

I know where this girl works, and I'm thinking about going in there one day to talk to her and to see where it goes. But I question if that's the right decision. 

We're both in our 20's, and are in seemingly similar places of being kind of alone and unsure of if it'll ever change. She tries to act like she's having fun, but she seems lonely deep down, and I am too. The way we carry ourselves is similar, of being the type who is more quiet and reserved, who acts like we've got it together, and takes awhile to open up to someone. 

I didn't feel an immediate spark when I first met her, although I did feel an attraction. I don't know if this yearning for her that I've been feeling is actually feelings for her, of it's just me being scared of being alone. I am the type to take awhile before accepting that I like someone.

The last time we spoke there was mention of a New Years party, and I expressed my interest in going. I went because I thought she was going to be there, and she wasn't. She knew I was going to be going, and if she were interested in getting to know me, she should have been there. She also looked right through me when holding a door open once, so I don't know if she likes me at all. 

She has a tattoo in the same place that my ex does. This worries me because it took me awhile to accept liking her as well, and she turned out to be a very cold, deceptive individual.  I also built my ex up to be this deep sensitive girl that she wasn't. I don't know if I'm doing the same here. 

I really don't know if she's guarded like I am and likes me, or if it's all in my head. I don't know if this girl was just being friendly to me of if she thought I was cute. What should I do?",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/erozoy/is_this_girl_interested_and_should_i_do_anything/,1579578464

858,Good-looking men with markedly less attractive female partners,"I'm curious to find out what goes through your mind when you encounter a man who is, to all appearances, a good-looking or otherwise attractive guy, romantically partnered with a woman whom you regard as unattractive — she may not even be physically unattractive, generally speaking, but when her looks are contrasted with the man's, you can't help but notice a discrepancy.

To be clear, I'm not implying that there should be a match or a close gap between one partner's physical beauty and the other's. I should also note that to explore this idea it would be best to imagine that the ""discrepancy"" is significant, i.e. a guy you think is *hot* with a gal you think is physically unattractive.

We're all familiar with the usual explanations and judgements people give when the situation is flipped (hot gal with physically unattractive guy), but I'd like to see what you have to say should you come across a couple in the opposite, presumably less common scenario. Draw upon actual experience or just imagine what you might think.

I'm wondering about things like your knee-jerk reaction and what you might speculate about the nature of the guy's interest in his partner. I think it's fair to state that men disproportionately favour youth and beauty compared to other qualities, so I have to imagine that when a woman sees a man apparently holding other qualities in higher regard, that it must stand out; it must make you think.

I also wonder what you might think in this situation should you happen to feel strong sexual attraction towards the guy, or should you have a genuine desire to date or become an intimate with him — *and* you regard yourself as better-looking than his current partner. Alternatively, what if his partner were about as equally attractive as you? What if she was more attractive? I would imagine that you would experience different thoughts and feelings in each scenario.

There's more detail that I could add to my hypothetical scenarios, but I'll leave it at that. I'd be interested to see what anyone has to say on the topic, even if you don't directly address any of the specific situations I mentioned above.

I was bending over picking something up and these guys in a truck yelled ""Hey! Nice Ass""

I calmly said ""what did you say to me?""

They immediately rolled up their window laughing. 

I went into a full out ptsd rage mode (which has only happens once before).

I went over and knocked on their passenger window and knocked HARD. 

They yelled ""hey fuck off"" from inside the truck. Still laughing. 

I ripped open the passenger side door and yelled ""do you have something to fucking say to me"" 

They both looked like they were going to piss themselves. The one in the driver seat said ""we didn't say anything""

The one in the passenger seat said ""how about you close the fucking door""

I responded quickly with ""how about you go fuck yourself""

I then slammed the car door in his face and stood there. Arms crossed. Staring them down. 

The guy in the driver seat rolled down the passenger window and asked what I wanted to talk about. I said that I heard what they yelled at me, he offered a half ass apology and then asked if I could leave because I was making him uncomfortable.

865,What do you think about the guy when he is nervous and awkward while approaching you?,"Everywhere it’s said that women hate it when a guy approaches but is nervous/awkward. However, I have this curiosity to know if that’s true  for everyone.

A little background.  I am a less than average looking guy because of a snub nose. But take  care of my health and hygiene. I’m good with social interaction, keep  making friends and do really well with clients (I’m in consulting).  Saying this just to let you know that I’m not awkward in general.

One  thing which is a pain point for me is that if I have a crush on  someone, I CANNOT be the same confident guy when I’m approaching them  for just saying hi. Even if I know that they’ve seen me being really  confident with other girls.

Here’s  the reason I’m asking this. There’s a girl I had a huge crush on and I  kept catching her looking at me and we had tons of eye contact (it was  borderline crazy). But then I approached her to say hi when she was  alone and I was nervous. She definitely saw through it and went cold  after that. And I backed off.

I  have been in a situation when I was talking to a girl who was nervous  and I really liked it. May be because I can relate to that and know that  it’s genuine.

Our dates go great; I feel very connected to her and there's a sense of comfort and warmth to being around her that I've never felt before. We've both admitted that we really like each other and want to see how it'll progress. The issue is that I feel there's a disparity in our ""needs"". 

She's busy, is out from 6 am - 7pm most weekdays and takes care of her grandma at home sometimes. But she also heads out with her friends quite often. We see each other 1 or 2 times a week, never more than a few hours. I'm absolutely fine with how often we see each other a week, might like to spend more than 3 hours with her sometimes but it's cool, I get it. I feel like I only feel needy the days between dates. 

We really only text about when our next date is or what we're gonna do, which is great and all earlier on but I don't see things progressing. Sometimes I'd just like to call her up, once or twice a week just to hear her voice, ask her how she's doing, tell her about my day, that sorta thing. If she can't call, that's fine! Maybe we can just text for a while some days, not too long, just have something more sustained than what we have now. 10 minutes. I don't care. I just wanna know how she is, what's going on, learn more about her and vice versa. I don't need to do this every day, I'd just like to get to know her more outside of our dates. 

I don't know. Most of the time she takes nearly a day to reply, which means I can't really communicate with her well this way. Usually on our dates she'll take out her phone and drop a reply or two to her friends though, and she's fairly active on her social media. 

I asked a couple of friends about this and while some say it's just differences between us, others say it's me being too needy or clingy or whatever. And she has told me in the past she tries her hardest to make time for me, and I do try and believe her, but sometimes I feel like it doesn't take more than 30 secs to reply to me.

1059,Same Guy... Two Dating Profiles on Same Site,"So I said I would not try online dating again. I finally came back around to giving it another try and I thought I met a nice guy? He has a consistent personality. Which didn´t set off red flags. The profile I saw was of this guy saying He loved God and he went to Missippi and UGA. Typical for what he said his career was. He said he worked at a law firm. Pretty sure googling him would bring up the same photo. 

However... 

There is a second profile... that says he went to Georgetown and worked at a tax type job. The 2 year descrepency in his age could be an old profile... but its on Hinge and I don´t know Hinge is that old. One says he would take you to a bar... the other his faith is so important. 

He wanted to meet up this week... but now I don´t feel comfortable. We switched numbers already. I could always say I changed my mind about being ready to date... because honestly it creeps me out a little and don´t want to peeve anyone off... 

Maybe I´m just not used to what might be typical for random creepy people. How would this make you feel? What´s the best next step? I know I´m not comfortable.

1120,Do you believe past lives are real? Have you had any experiences? If past life regressions are legitimate then all of the information I dredged up would indicate I was one of the Oracles of Delphi. Asking here anonymously and in a room of female support and non-judgement...,"Asking anonymously in a room of women because this is personal and I work in a field where this will, frankly, be viewed very strangely by colleagues. I consider myself to be a grounded, well-adjusted woman with a successful career, a committed husband and beautiful kids, and a lot of passion for my work. My mom is into the idea of past lives and so, out of pure curiosity, I tried a self-hypnosis session just to see what happened. I’m not sure what to make of it, and see if anyone has experienced anything like this. 

First, after a lead-in of visualized relaxation the guy in the recording suggests you ask yourself a question that you’d like to know about your past life. I ask myself, when have I been in a position of leadership when I’ve been able to help the most people? I have no idea what I’m going to see, but I’m relaxed... and my eyes kind of flicker back and forth quickly under my eyelids. I’m not asleep, but I see images and just kind of let them come to me.

The first image I see is a of a purple flower. It’s a sort of thick thistle with a bulbous stem and rounded top with points. Ok, sure. The next thing that materializes is a man’s face.  

This is where it gets crazy. I can feel anger building up in me and am so disgusted at the sight this man. Tears slowly trickle down the side of my face. This man has a short beard and short curly hair, piercing eyes, and I know he is powerful. He is very, very powerful and has control over the lives of thousands and thousands of people that live down below. And he is cruel. I see these people, they are my people too, and I know they are suffering because of this man’s decisions. They lack food and are struggling, all due to this asshole’s poor decisions, greed, and mismanagement. This man listens to no one. Except me. He listens to me because I am more powerful.

I think about myself. Who am I? I am a woman. I am pure. I am pure and no man can touch me. I think about where I am. I’m sitting in a sort of sunken in stone rectangle inside an enormous open stone chamber. Long prongs stick out. This is where I spend most of my time. There is another woman who spends time with me, who does what I do but is more junior, I am the most revered which is why that man only comes to me for advice. This other woman, she is my oldest son. I don’t know how to explain it other than by the fact that I just know that she is the same person as my oldest son.

More images and understanding of who I am comes to me. There are hallucinogenic drugs, and I take them. I take them regularly. I am encouraged to take these drugs. I am religious. I look down and see my dark red robe with gold stitching, it is my favorite robe. I am seen as in touch with higher beings. I am respected and my word is taken as word from the gods. 

There are snakes. Live snakes, and their significance is important to who I am. These snakes are not poisonous, but are often around me. There are several big, long snakes around me, different types. 

I give advice. I know that the most important advice I give is to this asshole of a leader. I know how to manipulate this man and I am proud when this leader makes changes to spread resources to the people, so they have food. I am responsible for these changes because he did not want to do it but I made him. Because of who I am.

I know that I died of some sort of toxicity or poison. The toxicity built up in my body until I eventually died. I’m holding white flowers that look kind of like lilies of the valley, as I die. 

A bit after this session I kind of doze a bit and then keep relaxed and thinking about all of these images and I decide shit, this is so strange, I’m going to google this stuff and see what comes up. Scroll scroll scroll, high snake priestess. Scroll again and there it is, Pythia of Delphi.The Oracle of Delphi. The series of priestesses who, over hundreds of years, occupied the role of the most powerful woman of the classic era.

It all fits, the pythons and pythos, the hallucinogens, the temple of Apollo, the advice given to powerful statesmen over hundreds of years. Different Emporers, some very cruel. Like Nero and Caligula. I google image the landscape of the ruins at Delphi. I’ll be damned. One of the first images that pops up shows the ruins... and they are surrounded by thick, bristly purple thistles. They grow all around that area. 

I’ve never been to Greece, or had any sort of overt connection to the culture. I once took a course on Ancient Greece in college years ago, and that’s literally the extent of my prior knowledge besides anything else I’ve been exposed to in popular culture. I don’t even remember having learned anything significant about the Oracle of Delphi in that course, and it certainly didn’t stick with me all these years later. 

And that’s it. As I said, I am not a person who would take this at face value and I still have my doubts at whether I am just imagining these things. One thing I can say: the emotions are very real. Even now I can still feel anger and disgust towards this man when I picture his face, although it’s been a day since. The anger has faded, but it’s there. I have no explanation for these feelings.  

But yet, here I am, and somehow I think that, at one time in my past, may I have been one of the Oracles at Delphi?",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/er6xo8/do_you_believe_past_lives_are_real_have_you_had/,1579489153

1131,Women attracted to men: Would you date a trans man? How about with little to no experience?,"I am a trans guy and consider myself to be exclusively heterosexual (IME, so far, anyway). I just posted asking for dating advice (mostly related to apps) in the ""binary FTM"" subreddit. A lot of my post revolved around a lack of sexual experience (but also relationships in general) due to dysphoria. But then it occurred to me, I could probably ask this here. Here is a part of my post:

&gt;Most of my avoidance is due to the dysphoria around sex, but it just gets worse over time because then I start to doubt myself because of lack of experience. I actually confirmed that I was trans after a therapist that was trying to figure this out with me in high school suggested I try to imagine being sexual as both a man and a woman - with both men and with women. The only thing that clicked was with me as a man with a woman. But to this day, that is the only way I see myself doing anything sexual, so it is kind of a huge mental block.

I have seen a lot of ""would you date a trans man?"" (and also, for that matter, ""would you date a virgin?"") come up both here and elsewhere on the internet. What often does not come up is the sex specifics. I guess people tiptoe around that a lot? I have seen a lot of (straight) women answering that they wouldn't be able to be in a sexual relationship with someone who is using female anatomy, need the sex to be PIV, etc. 

What is ironic about this to me is that is the only way I have ever been able to see myself having sex or get turned on at all, which is what causes me so much dysphoria and avoidance of sex in the first place. 

Before I transitioned, I think dysphoria has made me less interested in girl-on-girl stuff as well, because if I ever tried to identify with one of the girls I would get dysphoria to the point of being nauseated more than anything else. I am not even turned on by straight porn that involves a trans man and a cis woman (to be fair, in a lot of that, the trans men are sexually taking more of a female role, which is more of a turnoff), I can't imagine myself as them in the same way...so you see where that would be an issue. 

I refuse to do anything sexual unless I find a solution where it is essentially no different than a biological male (so far I haven't found this solution and am still looking; I must be very picky, because a lot of the prosthetics and sex toys that work for many trans men just make things seem even more fake to me...) Not being able to father children also contributes to my dysphoria, and I hope that in my lifetime medical science finds a solution to this as well. 

So a more specific version of this question: Would you date a trans man who requires being in a male ""role"" sexually, but because of this, also has little to no dating/sexual experience?",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/er6f2z/women_attracted_to_men_would_you_date_a_trans_man/,1579486601

1135,"Have you ever had an incident that made you believe you were ""ugly""?

I had an incident (quite a while ago) where I pursuing a guy  and where I honestly believed that he was interested in me as well. Then, I found out from my friend that this guy had been going around calling me an orangutang and expressing extreme disgust about the fact that I was interested in him. Obviously, I was very upset. I had never thought of myself as super hot or conventionally attractive up to that point, but I didn't know that I wasn't ugly to the point where I was likened to the image of an orangutang. 

Now, I have a boyfriend who tells me I'm beautiful and I've tried to forget about that incident, but it still remains in my mind to this day. (FYI - I'm East Asian (korean), skinny (120lbs with muscles from dance), and my skin's fairly clean without any pimples) I don't think I'm very beautiful nor very ugly, but the word ""orangutang"" sometimes floats back up into my brain and makes me believe that I'm truly ugly.

1154,Boyfriend with super close female friend?,"To start: I’ve already talked this over with him and he said they’re just good friends, and he just wants to help her because she has a lot of mental health problems and financial problems. He’s been helping her with rides and such over the last couple of days because her car is in the shop. 
It’s important to mention that he is 27 and she is 44, and he has stated the age difference as a reason why he wouldn’t like her. I’m 22 so our ages are a little closer. He says that they just have a lot of stuff in common and she’s fun to hangout with and then went back to the just wanting to be a friend for her because she is struggling. We were all at one point coworkers. Her and I still are but he isn’t any longer. It’s important to note, they had a casual friendly relationship before him and I even started talking. 

He’s been pretty transparent about all the times they’ve been together hanging out (only twice) and when they’re texting (which is.. semi-frequent, every day to every other day as of late) and doesn’t see an issue with the friendship. I am trying to be understanding but he bailed on me and a conversation that I wanted to have to hangout and watch netflix with her (he invited me and said we could talk after and when I said no he kept asking if I was sure). His reasoning is that we have this convo frequently and I usually don’t end up talking much about what I want to talk about (this is fair). When I got upset and asked him to take her home to talk to me, he did without any protesting. We talked, he reassured me that they’re just friends and I don’t have anything to worry about and if anything changed he would tell me.

Am I right to be anxious here or should I take it at face value? He didn’t seem weird or get upset when I asked if anything was going on between them. He just said no and explained why that wasn’t the case. I even asked him more than once and nothing ever changed just that they’re friends and he wants to support her. I think they are hanging out again tonight (I am out of town dog sitting so I haven’t been home).

1173,I have never told anyone the full story of me (23/m) and her (25/f) until now. But now I need some advice.,"Everything started off  back in 2016 when we both were on our first year at University. We went into different study programs, but we had classes in the same university buildings. When I first saw her, I was completely blown away by her. The way she walks, her looks, her style, her expression. You get the idea. I saw her occasionally on the floor and I found out later that she also noticed me. A couple of months passed, and I became good friends with someone that knew her very well and that was basically my gateway ticket for getting to know her personally. I took that chance and we got to know each other. From that point on we saw each other frequently also because there was exam season during that time. For about half a year we keep close ties with each other and would hang out regularly when we were doing stuff for our classes.

Now before I continue, I should mention that she is rather introverted and usually does not talk to guys at all. She needs to fully trust a person to express herself. Regarding myself, I am a really outgoing person and I like to create positive vibes and bond with people, I have a basic level of trust for everyone and I generally try my best to give a positive outlook when I talk to people. We both had just 1 serious relationship prior of knowing each other. I had also some acquaintances, but they were just short flings that I do not consider worthy mentioning any further.

We had a really good time together and I have to say that I didn't asked her out for a date yet because of her rather closed character and also because I have to get approval by her family first, especially by her bothers, which is really hard to get. We share the same cultural heritage and our culture makes is additionally difficult to just get things going on romantically. So I waited and continued to create a strong bond with her. I actually never have developed such deep feelings for someone except from that girl. **I was attracted by her looks but I fell in love with her personality.** She has by far one of the best personality and character traits I have ever seen in a human being.

Things were going great between us but on one day we were sitting next to each other and I thought she was feeling uncomfortable with me sitting next to her and i suggested her that I move places to give her some more space. Boy have I been wrong. She actually liked sitting next to me as I realized later on but she took my suggestion completely wrong and afterwards started to hate me. And I felt that something was odd with her afterwards. She straight went to the bathroom and she cried there most probably. At this day I legit died emotionally. I was having a deep negative approach in my life, that could have easily been developed into a full blown depression. Al the effort I had made prior to get to know her and gain her trust were gone in a matter of moments. Through intervention of another common friend of ours, we were able to forgive each other.

At that point I expressed her my feelings for and she said that she was not feeling the same way for me as I feel for her and she assured me that she no longer hates me. But what I strongly think is, that she felt the same way for me but she was too ashamed of herself to admit having feelings for me because of what had happened between us.

For the sake of her letting in peace and for me trying to get over her, I cut the contact with her. We came across each other occasionally on the hallway, but we didn't talk with each other.

Last summer I graduated from college and she is now in her last year (my study program lasted 3 years and hers last 4). On December 24th, 2019 I was entering the campus to visit some friends I still had there and then I saw her sitting alone in the cafeteria studying. I first went straight to pass her but I returned and moved towards her, because all in all that was the only thing I have been wanting for the last two years, apart from getting my degree. We had a conversation about our lives and caught up how things have been going for us so far. It just felt exactly like the good times we had when we used to hang out together while we were studying.

I know this girl for over 3 years now and I know I should get over her but I just can't. I've already tried everything. There has been no week passing without me thinking of her at least once. I wasn't able to cope the same feeling that I have for her with the other girls I have been out so far and I think I never will. I have a good social life, I have a loving and caring family, I go regularly to the gym for 6 years now and I am currently employed and have a high salary. I should be really looking for my future but I just can't considering that she is not by my side.

My question now are if I should try to contact her? And if so, how should I do that? I don't have her number since the time we had an argument. She recently deleted her Instagram and I don't have an account on Facebook. Would it be considered creepy or even sick if I try to contact her, seemingly out of the blue? And should I finally tell her how I feel for her like I am telling you right now?

TLDR; I know a girl for 3 years and I now want to keep in touch with her again, after 2 years of no contact (we had an argument because of a misunderstanding, that we have resolved by now). 2 Months ago I saw her again and we had a nice conversation. I actually have never stopped having feelings for her since the day I first saw her and I was not able to get over her, regardless of what I did. What should I do now?

I am really looking forward for your answers and suggestions. I am grateful for every advise that I could get.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/er4awx/i_have_never_told_anyone_the_full_story_of_me_23m/,1579476532

1229,How to get over someone it was never going to work with.....,"Hi all.

Today I just was officially dumped and ended a toxic 4 year long on again, off again relationship. 

Things between us were very toxic for a while and I think we both have known it wasn't going to work out, but we were in love with eachother so we kept trying.

The relationship began to crumble because of a lot of reasons, both things out of our control and bad things he did, and bad things I did. It was definitely not one person's fault. 

Anyways this morning he officially dumped me by sending me a message saying ""fuck you, you ruined my life and broke my heart, you will never hear from me again"" and blocked my number, and blocked me on all social media.

Even though I know it wasn't my fault, the fact that he pointed blame at me saying I ruined his life and broke his heart is making me feel extremely guilty and I keep wondering what I could have done differently to make it end more peacefully.  (Logically I know I couldn't have, but I can't kept the guilt feeling)

All in all I feel like complete trash and there's nothing I will do to ever rescue this relationship so I need to get over it as soon as possible.  But at this point it's the only thing on my mind and I have no idea how I'm going to forget him and get over this. Any advice or help please.

Her birthday is coming up, and like most people, I’d like to get her a thoughtful gift.

This question isn’t *only* about her birthday, obviously this needs to happen anyways, but it almost seems like she’s hesitant to really display her interests.

I ask questions about what her interests are and such, but she doesn’t provide a lot of information. I’ve tried to get her to play some her favorite music for me, but she thinks I won’t like it. I’d rather not have to resort to “hey what do you want for your birthday?” since that ruins the entire thoughtfulness aspect of a birthday gift.

1267,My fiancé (28M) and I (26F) tried the 36 questions to fall in love and it led to arguments and feeling distant.,"Hello, this is my first ever post to reddit (yay?). I am not really sure if this is the right sub for it, so sorry. My fiancé and I decided to try the 36 questions that lead to love (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/36-questions-that-lead-to-love.html)

Well, I guess I mean that I decided. We had finished our normal dinner and TV routine, and had gone our separate ways. I went to go read a book and he started playing videos games. An hour or two later he was finishing up Need for Speed Heat and switching to Spider-Man, and I got this urge to do something with him. So I looked up things to do on a rainy day and found the 36 questions. I asked him and we decided to give it a shot, though looking back now he seemed hesitant. 

Bit of background, we were housemates for a year and were the best of friends. A few months after I moved to another city we ran into each other and things became intimate, we have been in a relationship for three and a half years, living together for two years, and engaged for about 2 weeks.

Alright, back to the story. I made hot cocoa and peppermint schnapps, and he turned on the Netflix fireplace video. We snuggled up in some blankets on the couch with our feet in each others lap and started on the questions. Even with the first question things got weird. The question is who would you invite for dinner, he said this guy who’s name he couldn’t remember that could never be killed during WWI and eventually drowned in a river (sorry I tried to googling it and I couldn’t find the name), I said Jon Mulaney. He seemed noticeably upset. As we kept going through things, he would get really upset if I tried to start a conversation from our answers (which is what I am pretty sure you are supposed to do). For instance, for the would you want to be famous question, he said he would want to be famous but after death. I asked why would you want something that you could never know happened or experience and if that meant he believed in some kind of afterlife? He got really mad and said he felt like I was putting him on trial.  As this continued, we kept moving farther apart on the couch.

At the question about your fondest memory, he said he didn’t have any. I probed him, trying to be playful about it because I could feel he was getting into one of his moods, by saying well I know you have some memories even if they are just from today, which of those are the fondest? He got so argumentative that I said I think we should stop and we started getting ready for bed.

To be fair *cue in Letterkenny repeats* he has never talked about his childhood, he can’t remember any of it and it is kind of a sore subject for him. His mom thinks something happened at school, because he was a very extroverted happy kid and then suddenly became quiet and reclusive.  

We went to bed amicable but I could feel the tension and a feeling of uncertainty.

TL;DR My fiancé and I tried the 36 questions to make you fall in love and it led to arguments and feeling less connected. I am now questioning our compatibility and whether he really likes me and enjoys my company.

Has this happened to any of you? All I have read online has been people either having the best experience or getting bored with the questions. None of them leading to fights.

Was he just in a bad mood and I should have waited to try it until he seemed like he really wanted to? 

Or is this a sign of a more underlying issue?

Guys stare at her, come up and talk to her in the street etc. She especially gets tonnes of attention when clubbing, bad attention. Guys will constantly come up to her every time she goes out without fail. They grind against her, grab her waist, stick their hands up her shorts, last night a guy even grabbed her face. The thing is about her is she is the sweetest person I know in the world and it's completely out of her nature to tell anyone to fuck off or go away. She gets less attention if she is with guy friends or me, but she is mostly out with girlfriends and I live in another city so she gets all this constant attention. It really upsets her because she just wants to have a good night out with friends but everytime without fail there will have been at least a couple incidents. She tells guys she has a boyfriend but they don't listen, she swaps around with girls in a dancing circle if guys come up to her but they follow. I just don't know what she can do to prevent all this:(

They usually just do regular grooming even if they aren't traditionally attractive. I am not in any way implying it's necessarily wrong to modify your body by this question, but i do see a paradox with body modification habits mostly from women. Based on what I've heard before in random documentaries from some decent looking women's motivations for getting body modifications (to become more attractive), it seems that the reason for doing it appear to be much more often than not, totally unnecessary. I have my own thinking about this riddle, but I figure, why not ask a whole community of women? If any of you women who have gotten body modifications before could shed some light on your reasoning for doing it when there is no medical or health reason why and you are doing it purely for cosmetics, that would be very helpful.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/equifx/what_is_the_answer_to_the_riddle_of_why_many/,1579427905

I recently noticed that I hate my femininity.  I'm a 26 year old  heterosexual  women, and I just try to copy anything men are doing. I walk like them, talk like them to a extent even dress like them. I have short hair and wear no make up and only jeans and tops or shirts. For years I thought that was my choice. But in past month I came to a realization that I would love to be more feminine. I would love long hair and other stuff, but I consider it weak. 

I checked this with my other friends also and I think to a certain extent we have internalized misogany.  Most of my women friends think, like me - 

1. Pink is a childish colour.
2. Wearing make up means you are vain
3. participating and enjoying in any traditionally feminine task means you are not strong. (Cooking, sewing, etc.)

I can go on in details, when I digged deep I found out that its more connected to my role models, till date my role models have been - 

1. Various tom boys from local media (Who never change to women)
2. A local general (her name is Kiran Bedi, highly inspirational at least few years ago, but again she is a tom boy.)
3. Brian of tarth - from Game of thrones
4. Arya  Stark- from Game of thrones

Please note, Im not saying that this characters and women are not good, I'm just saying that this was their choice. And I would like to do whatever I do by choice, not by some internalized hatred towards femininity. 

I want to know more role models who are strong, independent feminine women. I would love it if they are fictional.  A good example would be  Daenerys  from GOT, but they ruined her arc.

1359,I think a female voice might be what I need 36(M),"This might end up being a bit long winded so sorry up front. 
So I have been with my girlfriend for 10 years and it's great, I love her and she loves me, but... there it is, but. 

My interest in intimacy has declined to critical levels with her :( 
Now we have never had a exciting sex life, pretty mundane and to the point, and it never really bothered me in the past. 

In the last couple years however the conventional nature if the whole process of having sex has wore on me, and I know that sounds bad, but that's how it feel now, a process. Now I have never directly compared her to past relationships sexually, because the love it true. However I can't lie that the sex was a lot more... oh, raw I guess, and I'm missing it, I feel like I'm missing out on something bigger then sex right now. Not sure how to explain it but, I don't have perverse kinks, that are creepy, or painful.
Just I'd like more then missionary!

We talk a good game when dinking or out partying, but that about it, talk! 
I would really like to open up or bedroom life, but I don't even know what I want and that's a problem. She has dropped very very buzzed hints she maybe could play with another female, but I'd be off limits. So I never pushed it, I would probably be ok if she wanted another male, maybe. She has never hinted and I'm not gonna bring that up lol
I think about sex all the time and I find myself thinking about unfaithful ideas and I have done that in the past and it blew up in my face. 
I'm sure in her mind I'm not pulling my weight, I've tried to spice things up, I think. Brought up the GoPro idea and that got denied, ok no problem ( I really want to do that) I mentioned porn, and toys, nothing yet. I could probably just slap one of her DVDs she has tucked away with bad acting, and a half ass attempt at a story line and get away with it lol, not my style but hey once the action starts who cares about s**t dialogue, and a few other ideas along the way.
Now I could keep going and going here but then it just turn into a me complaining, and I bet who ever actually reads all this gets the idea.

So there it is, I more just needed to get that out and I really am hoping that maybe some females have been in my shoes so I could get just your mind and how it effected you I guess.

So sorry for the rambling, but that has been on my mind for some time and had no one I was able to talk to with out it hitting damn social media!",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/eqtyyv/i_think_a_female_voice_might_be_what_i_need_36m/,1579423747

1383,[Serious] - Will becoming a physician help me find a girlfriend?,"I'll try to keep this short instead of delving into a bunch of backstory. Basically I turn 28 in less than a month, and I'm so lonely. I've always struggled with women, and it's taking a toll on me. I just want someone to share my life with, to come home to after a long day and to cuddle up in front of the TV with. I'll never understand why that's so hard to find. I know I have a lot of flaws, but we all do, and I think I have some positive qualities too.

Anyway, I was a pharmacist for a couple of years before deciding that I was unsatisfied with that career and wanted to be a physician, and I'm currently in my second year of medical school. It's no secret that there's a large amount of prestige associated with being a physician, and I'll admit that part of me is hoping that once I graduate, having the ""MD"" after my name will help me finally fulfill my dream and find a woman who eventually wants to marry me.

[Chivalry’s Not Sexist, It’s Pro-Women](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/chivalrys-not-sexist/)

It’s hilarious most of the time but sometimes they get  feisty! I don’t know why they think a 20 year old is going to date a teenager honestly. But they always try to flirt with him and get upset when he doesn’t initiate anything.

1471,I have to break up with a great guy and I’m not sure the best way to go about it?,"I’ve been seeing this guy for about a month. He’s great, literally everything I’ve asked for in a man, except I don’t feel the connection. I thought it would eventually develop but it hasn’t on my end. However, he’s really into me and eager about me and he definitely thinks there’s a connection on his end. 
Besides me not feeling a connection he’s just way too eager for me. Like the type of guy who has no life outside of the relationship bc he completely caters to his partner. Like wanting to spend every day off with me, goes along with whatever I want or say and that’s just not attractive to me. I like it when someone has their own life, hobbies, doesn’t just go along with whatever, has an opinion. At first I thought he was like that bc he was nervous but he’s gotten even more like that which has turned me off and I’ve kind of gotten withdrawn from tbe relationship tbe past week. Which I do find weird that he hasn’t seemed to pick up on my change of mood over the past week. I haven’t been texting him like I normally did, haven’t been super flirty anymore or reciprocating his sweet comments and stuff. Either he does notice and doesn’t wanna say anything/in denial, or he’s so head over heels that he’s oblivious to it. Either way I don’t want to string him along and need to break it off in the nicest way ASAP. I’ve never had to break up with a good guy before and am not sure what to say. Every guy I’ve broken up with did something bad to cause it. 

Im also worried about how to do it bc a close mutual friend set us up and I don’t want to look like the bad guy or be seen as the heartbreaker bc this guy seems to really think I’m the one based on the things he says and does.",AskWomen,/r/AskWomen/comments/eqoeq6/i_have_to_break_up_with_a_great_guy_and_im_not/,1579390722

She is absolutely stunningly beautiful and has a great personality. I’ve asked her out and got a half-assed yes and ultimately decided not to pursue her. Then a few months go by and we hook up once and we both have a good time and she says she down for it again but she never was really down if I made a move or straight up asked her. Then I just straight up asked her if she’s actually interested and again got some vague answers until I told her I need a definitive yes or no and she said we should just be friends. 

But we go to school together I have to see her all the time and I hate it. She is just so damn perfect in my eyes but I know I should move on I just can’t. I know many guys will say to just find another girl but it’s not that easy for me. I don’t get much luck on the apps or real life. I already go to the gym and I’m in decent shape, and between school, going to the gym, and running errands I don’t have much time for anything else. I kind of just sit around and wallow in my self hatred. Wishing I was good enough for her. God I hate myself for even thinking that but I straight up don’t feel good enough for her. She is like the happiest, most positive full of life person I’ve met and I just can’t match that level and she can smell my depression from a mile away. Anyways, any advice would be well appreciated.

1527,"Embarrassing question... I have a chronic illness that makes it hard for me to engage in sexual things with my boyfriend. In what ways can I make up for it, if at all?","Quick summary of my issues:

-	I have recurrent UTIs so sex is generally a bit stressful (because I get worried about developing another UTI). I am resistant to like 7-8 antibiotics already for treating UTIs, and antibiotics also totally worsen my chronic stomach disorder, so I’m often delaying antibiotic usage and let a UTI infection last months before I finally treat it. I developed another chronic condition, interstitial cystitis, just because of how frequent and long I have UTIs. So after sex I have to immediately pee and shower, and hydrate a lot for the next week. It’s really stressful. 


-	I thought oral sex would be a great alternative, but I usually can’t take most of him in my throat. Last night we finally found a great position where he can get in farther, but my throat’s been raw all day... I’m kind of nervous to bring up to him that it’s probably not a good idea for me to keep going that deep. I feel like such a s****y gf. 

The worst part is he’s extremely sexually attractive to me. He is fine with not having sex if it means pain or problems for me, but I just can’t resist him at all and still end up initiating - and causing myself stress down the line. 

Are there any other healthy alternatives for us?? Something where both of us can be satisfied? 

I will ask in an askwomen’s thing as well, as they may have more insight for what I can do. But I’m curious from a man’s perspective if I can compensate for these stressors or if I’m just sexually useless.

1594,Any guys here have a relationship with a girl who you thought was the one only to have external circumstances get in the way? What happened?,"I [26M] met girl[25F] in July. We connected on a crazy level, that same wavelength kind of shit. It was amazing. Never met anyone like her and vice versa. She got some bad news in August and we abruptly stopped talking. August sucked pretty bad for me, and September was a little better. We started talking again at the end of September with the agreement of just being friends.

That agreement lasted all of two days and we ended up getting closer and closer. She told me she loved me in the middle of October. We officially became a couple in November. She ended up getting more bad news about one of her parents’ health two days later and became incredibly distant. I didn’t see her for the entire month we were an official couple (two of those weeks she was out of town visiting her parent). We broke up after our first legit argument which was me wanting to see her, and her not having capacity. She blew up on me and took a lot of things I said completely out of context and used them against me which she never did before. I apologized profusely but to no avail- we were done. I called her two days after we broke up, just to apologize for how things played out, and that I acknowledged we weren’t fit to be in a relationship at the moment due to the shit she has going on as well as my own attachment issues, but that I didn’t think the way this played out was reflective of how a relationship would be with us if the external circumstances didn’t introduce themselves at the beginning of our relationship (not blaming her at all, it was just bad timing for something to happen). She never responded.

I had bad anxiety the last two weeks we were talking and once we broke up it was completely alleviated, like I had my answer. It’s been a month and a half and I just miss her like crazy, not just at a romantic level, but as a person. I had to block her on all social media, but I kept her phone number. I don’t plan on reaching out to her any time soon, but I may down the road. I’m not hoping for anything at this point and have been doing great things since we broke up, but I still think about her all the time.

I’m (F/25) working on making 2020 a better year for me. I have so far gotten a new car, new phone, accepted a new job, and ended things with a guy who just wasn’t ever going to give me what I wanted. 

On to my question: I’ve been following this guy on Instagram for years that I know from my gym. Occasionally I respond to his stories. He likes my posts. He hasn’t posted in over a year. Not a big social media guy. 

I responded to his last story and we sparked up a conversation. Eventually I suggested I would be interested in working out or hiking sometime. 

He said “Absolutely we should do that soon” and I replied great! What is your work schedule like?  He said “Monday through Friday 8-6 😭 unfortunately in *location*” 

So I said that’s awesome we can plan for a Saturday or Sunday and asked what he did. 

This was on Sunday and he still hasn’t responded or read it. He’s posted a story or two but it was just a sport related thing. I’m trying to change my perspective this year and go with the flow. If we workout and make a connection, awesome! If we workout and it feels more like friends, thats cool too. If we don’t workout then I’ll be ok.

While playing together, we talk via voicechat for hours, deep into the night, about all kinds of stuff, and the conversations are quite intimate from time to time (our friends, our families, our deepest fears, our wishes, our past, etc.). We've gotten quite close and we have a lot in common. We text eachother every day as well, asking about eachothers day, sending eachother funny memes or cute pics of our pets. I think I might like him, but I just don't know whether this could be mutual. The conversations are never flirtatious, which could mean that he's not interested in me, or maybe he's afraid too? (he told me he's never had a relationship before and I think he might be kind of insecure about himself). I tried dropping hints, but they seem to go over his head. If I'm a little bit more sure that he likes me, I would like to ask him to meet up, to see whether we have the same connection in real life.

It started when I started to have feelings for this girl right, whenever I see her I always just want to approach her but I cant since I think it might be weird and stuff, we do talk sometimes about stuff like shows and class related stuff but its very rarely and always with other people, my friends are very close to her too.

The pain in my chest just kept growing and growing day by day to the point I started to literally have a panic attack at school, it was a really embarassing moment since almost everyone saw it.

I tried solving this pain by confessing my feelings for her and she said that she was aight about it, I only confessed and I didnt really ask nor did I want to hear a response since it most probably backfire and Just cause me to feel even more hurt.

But now that I have told her about my feelings I started to feel that she is starting to distance herself from me gradually, we talk sometimes but its like very fucking small talks, my friends keep telling me that I have a chance with her but I know they are just teasing me, she is way more close to my friends than with me, like Im a complete outsider from their social circle, I even think she likes one of my friends since she always goes to him, teases him and stuff, and Just they look good together, I have never done those things with her and it pains me that I would never be able to do those things, maybe Im Just thinking too much, Im sorry for acting like a complete baby on the fucking Internet of all places, also sorry for the wrong formatting and out of order story telling, I Just wanted to get this out of my chest since it hurts too much, I cant talk with my friends about this since they dont really take all my shit seriously since I am the joker clown guy in their perspective...

I was one squirt into my orgasm when Diane walked in. She was literally 12 feet away. I was shocked, looked at her and pumped it hard 2 more times and immediate noticed her purple yoga pants.

Tinder is a shit app. Typically, I’m able to get my matches snapchat, or phone number, but far too often our plans will fall through, or they’ll ignore me after a few days.


Yesterday I matched with a girl who could very well be a model. We’re the same age, 20. 
Everyone knows you shouldn’t act excited on Tinder (so your matches get the impression you match with a lot of girls or whatever), but holy fuck; this girl is a smoke show. I sent her a message late last night (a few hours after we matched) that said something like. “Oh shittt, you’ve got to be the prettiest girl on this app”. I usually say something like “Hey pretty”, but no way that woul suffice. She hasn’t answered yet, and knowing tinder I wouldn’t be surprised if she unmatched lol. 


But now, I just don’t know what to do. Im assuming that if she answers, it’ll be some variant of “thanks!”, Then I’ll say something about her pics, or bio, and we’ll take it to a different app. But that’s not what I want.

My wife knows, isn't offended by it, removes her's for her job too (she also works with her hands).  I even offered to have mine as a tattoo since I just don't like wearing rings.  We're both in our early 40s, happily married, no interest in side action...it's never bothered me if she doesn't wear it.

I've had my family, in-laws, friends, and even my local 7-11 cashier ask me about why I sometimes have no ring on.  Do other fellow married guys regularly go without their wedding rings in daily life?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/esruuu/married_men_how_often_do_you_wear_your_wedding/,1579779211

My ex (who im on good terms with) and several other of my friends proceeded to tell me how i had a certain smell when i entered a room and it was subtly evident that i did enter the room. I asked whether it was gross or bad and they kept saying it was just different and kinda good. I however do not trust this a whole lot due to knowing that ur friends (not close)  will lie to protect ur feelings. Has anyone else had this problem or incident happen and figured out how to fix or whether it was actually good or bad? 
I use a moderate amount of dove men’s bodywash, and use pantene conditioner(for women) and dove men’s shampoo. I do not shampoo every day, only every other to preserve my hair. I use clothes that are washed and washed within the past week that i have in my closet. I wear deodorant and i use men’s Prada Black cologne and use one spray, 12 inches away on my collar. I dont know whether this smell is due to my hygiene habits and i havent ever had this pointed out to me before.

1740,What's with modern men preferring masculine women?,"Hear me out. I believe some current societal systems prevent women from being as open-hearted as they could be - it's just not safe. Women are, on their own, working to ditch excessively girly gender norms, stylistically and personality-wise opting for simplified, less razzle dazzle, more in-power positions in life.

Many of those things are good - women should be free to express themselves however, and given equal opportunity as men. But some of the less harmful attributes associated with femininity have fallen increasingly absent over the years, and neither men nor women seem to be mourning it.

Men seem to want to date women who are ""one of the guys"". Down-to-earth, low maitenance, sometimes even sloppy and belchy and sardonic - athletic drinks beer watches sport - kind of girls.

Are there any remaining appreciators of highly feminine women?

1751,What do you guys do when you find yourself s subtly crushing on someone?,"To give a little background context, I (24F) moved into a house with two guys (mid 20s). I keep getting a gut feeling that one of them (let’s call him Richard) likes me and there are a number of things why: 

1. he’s always prying on my schedule (eg where I’m going who I’m going with) 

2. he’s quite protective about me with either my guy friends or his friends who come over
 
3. whenever we hang out as a group he always compliments me to my friends or playfully flirt with me openly 

4. I’ve noticed the way he looks at me and there’s something intense with it that I can pinpoint on. Also I’ve noticed that he sneaks glances at me without me noticing

5. he would always remember the small things I like 

6. he’s never spoken to me about other girls/relationships/dating 

7. he would always either fix his hair or pace around the room whenever he speaks to me like he couldn’t stay still in one place

8. whenever my friends try and ask him stuff/flirt with him, he would always answer looking at me instead of them

9. before Christmas he told me he would only get presents for people he cared a lot about. On the actual day I found out he actually got me a bag with two bunnies kissing on it which was really cute. 

To give a bit more context, Richard is quite a shy guy - and only seems to have close guy friends than girls that are friends.

1780,Is it normal for a guy to cum in seconds from head/a BJ?,"Hi #AskMen! Woman here stepping into your subreddit. 

I made out on a bit of a whim with someone I share a mutual attraction with who is a few years older than I am and based on my impression, has far more sexual experience than I do. To cut to the chase, we began to make out, one thing led to another and again, I don't have much experience but what I love most about getting sexually intimate with someone is to please them and to try and convey my desire for them by making them feel like they are on top of the world with me. One thing led to another and my excitement to pleasure him lead me to unzipping his pants and I haven't given many BJ's in my life but 10 seconds in he's moaning away and shares he could cum any moment and around 5 seconds after that, came in my mouth (which I didn't mind at all and was more than happy to swallow). Right after, he pulled my face up, said he wouldn't mind tasting himself if that meant he could kiss me more.

Although I'm sure he enjoyed it in some sense, is it normal for someone to cum in 15 seconds?! I could care less if he came quickly (I am a little flattered he did - but should I be? Lol). Guess I am just worried I didn't do a good job. I was fully expecting to get to work for at least 2-5 minutes, especially for someone (who in my understanding) has dealt with some pretty experienced females beforehand that most likely have better skills than I do so it caught me by surprise I guess, and has my questioning myself lol.

You’re talking to an attractive girl online. (Tinder, hinge, bumble, etc)
You hit it off and plan a date. She looks cute in her pictures and you think you’ve hit the jackpot.
Date night comes around and you meet her at a pub, arcade or pick her up from her place.

The moment you see her you instantly realize IG filters and proper angles made her look like a fit 8 when in reality she’s an obese 5. 

What’s your next move? 


I’m a 6’1 fit guy, European, successful, etc. Basically I’m a catch and I know it. (Don’t get mad, if a woman said it it would be applauded.) 
But I’m getting tired of meeting with women from online that I’m in no way attracted to. 
Physical appearance is literally priority 1 for me, I want a trophy wife to compliment my life. I worked hard to build this life and I deserve that. 
Usually I get really good at googling their social media to find out what they look like actually. But sometimes that doesn’t work. 

So if you meet with a girl, find out she’s definitely not as advertised and you’re in no way attracted to her, what’s your move?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/espaqq/what_do_you_do_when_she_shows_up_looking_nothing/,1579761330

agreed too. The main reason I said that because, I don't know how to talk to girls. I just don't know what to say and get really awkward. Honestly, surprised she does like me.

Then we started hanging out after and cuddling, talking/having deep meaningful conversations, etc. Nowadays, we have sex for a bit and just chill for hours afterwards. Our relationship keeps increasing in intimacy sexually and emotionally, but if I hint about wanting to date (in general, not him specifically) he’ll get awkward. The thing is, he’s effectively doing all the things he’d do in a relationship WAY past normal fwb boundaries. He talks to me about weird dreams he’s had, family stuff, secrets he’s never told anyone, feelings he’ll usually keep to himself.

I’m not sure I want to date him or if i have actual feelings, but know he makes me feel more safe and comfortable than any other guy I’ve been with.

1844,How do you come to terms with having a wife who's superior to you in every way?,"My wife is amazing, honestly perfect to me, the only issue in our relationship is I have NO IDEA why she loves me.

She is far more educated than I am. She has her bachelor's, master's (x2), juris doctorate, and doctorate all from extremely prestigious universities, while I only have my bachelor's and a master's I got way later than she did. 

Because of this, she makes way more money than I do. She jokes that she hates when people say she makes ""6 figures"" because she makes at the HIGH-HIGH end of that (she would never tell anyone that though), and my income isn't even 6 figures. She loves her job and is such a workaholic so she just keeps climbing up the ladder, while I've been in my current position since the year we got married.

She's also the superior parent in every way. Completely home made baby food, and then completely home made toddler and kid food. She helps with our daughter's homework while cooking every evening, brushes our daughter's long-ass hair every night, and reads stories to her 50% of the nights (I do the other half.) Our daughter is 9 and my wife has shown her a world of opportunities that I didn't even know existed until I met her. Who knew you could hire a marine biologist to teach your 8 year old 1 on 1 about their work and take her on a submarine trip? I didn't!

Even her hobbies are more interesting than mine. She goes to pilates every week, she goes out with friends once a week and they always do cool things like wine painting. She takes our family to operas, and 5 star restaurants, and camping trips where she is the only one who knows how to do anything. I could go on for hours about how awesome she is, but I can't think of anything cool about me.

My wife briefly dated a medical student doing his residency before she met me, and now he's a super successful doctor and I feel like maybe she should have stayed with him instead of marrying my stupid self. I contribute nothing to our family. When my wife was pregnant, she talked about all the things her parents taught her and how she'd do those with our daughter. She asked what I'd show her and I didn't have an answer because my parents didn't give one single fuck about me growing up. I feel like the things I do do with my daughter are just in the shadows. Like I play chess with her while my wife brushes her hair, but obviously the hair brushing is more important for her wellbeing. 

I can't compete with my wife, but it's not a competition because we're happy in our marriage. She loves me even if I don't understand. I just have this fear that one day she'll wake up and realize that she's miles above me. 

Has anyone else had a situation like this? My wife says I just need to understand that she married me because she loves me and leave it at that but I feel so inferior to her.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/esmzsb/how_do_you_come_to_terms_with_having_a_wife_whos/,1579748104

However, we aren’t leaving for another 5 months. I hold an important accounting role and assist the CFO with the day to day tasks. Today she just told me she is leaving at the same time as I plan to resign, going on an overseas holiday for 3 weeks and wants me to run the show and manage everything whilst she’s away as no one else is trained or able. She’s trusting me to manage many high responsibility duties and to make sure things run smoothly.  (NOTE I have not told them about my leaving plans yet and am only required to give a months’ notice, we will have to hire and train someone before in a month before I go in which she will be away)..

1868,Self-Defense against a woman. Need help to defend myself without catching an assault charge.,"I, 23(M), recently broke up with my now ex-girlfriend in a mature and respectful manner, we're still friends. However, her bestfriend is unhinged (to say the least) and has made multiple threats and statements suggesting that the next time she sees me, there is going to be a physical altercation (I have text messages to prove it to the police). As our paths cross frequently around my university's campus, I feel this is inevitable and need help with this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 5'10, 160 lbs. with fighting experience and she is probably 5'2 100lbs. I am confident in my abilities to beat her in a fight but, like I said, she is unhinged and wishes to fight anyway. I am trying to figure out a way to handle this situation without doing unnecessary harm and without catching an assault charge. Obviously, the best option would be to not engage in a fight at all, but I would like to hedge my bets in case the worst happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would imagine that the best option would be to make it absolutely clear to witnesses that I am acting out of self defense: not strike first, maybe simply push her away until the situation is made clear. In the ideal scenario, I would be able to grapple her or pin her in some way without doing harm. However, I am concerned that even in this best-case, I could still be charged by police. Should I end it as soon as possible? Should I put myself at risk of injury in order to reduce the harm to her? Should I flee the scene after?

1881,How do I deal with the loneliness?,"So some backstory to my post is the following;

I'm a 23 year old attending school to become a TA. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
I have a girlfriend at the same age whom I lived with earlier. She decided she didn't want to live with me anymore but still wanted us to be together, and as I still love her ofc I agreed. 

I don't have a lot of friends and I never had any, I can't say a single person that I would call a close friend. It's not because of any toxic behavior, I'm a very nice guy, laidback, helpful, well atleast that's what people tell me. 

Now to what I need help with. 

I'm super lonely. I cry every night, sometimes even during the days when I'm just chilling in my lonely apartment. I miss my girlfriend  a lot, I long for some type of friendship but I don't know anyone. 
I've tried putting on some fun show like FRIENDS or The Office on the TV in the background while playing games and doing chores but it doesnt make me feel less lonely.

I came home from work to a note that basically read that she needs to leave to focus on her dream of being a doctor. She feels that I'm not ambitious enough and that she doesn't have enough time to be telling me what to do and study at the same time. She wants someone that pushes her to go further. She doesn't like that I spend my free time watching TV or playing video games, and says that I only leave the house if it's to go to work, the gym, buy groceries, etc. She wishes I would get involved in more things outside of the house, not that there's anything wrong with what I do, but that it is not what she wants in a partner. I frequently pick up hobbies and get very interested in something only to drop it a week later. She made it clear that she is still very much in love with me, but that things aren't working out right now. We have discussed that there may be a possibility of us being together again in the future, but that some things would have to be different.

As for my situation, I've been working to support us, having recently picked up a second job so that she could quit her job to study. I did not finish my bachelors degree, but I plan on returning to school in the near future. Finishing my bachelors is kind of out of the question because I wouldn't know what to do with an economics degree if I finished it. If I go back to school, it will be for a trade. I am also waiting on getting in to two police academies, as I scored very high on the civil service exams for both.

If you've read this far, thank you. Now this is where I need your advice. Really for the first time since college, I am completely in charge of my own life with nobody telling me what to do. My SO and I were very reliant on each other. How did some of you start over after leaving a long-term relationship? What are some things I can get involved with to keep myself busy?

1912,"How do you get over a break up, if you're still in love?","My girlfriend (23f) and I (23m), were in a relationship for 5 years and on Sunday she out of the blue said she wasn't in love with me. I'm still completely in love with her and it's so hard, it hurts. We are still friends though, we do still talk, not that much though because she told me we need space so it doesn't hurt as much for me.

There is a lot of context behind the breakup - which she had explained, and I completely understand why she did it. To get the jist of it, she was in a long term relationship prior to me, with only a 4 month break between the relationships. She said she wanted to find herself again, to find her happiness.

So i understand why she did what she did, which is why were still mutual, there's no animosity at all. There's still a lot more behind her break ups - but that's a story for another time. All I can be is supportive of her choice. It's just hurts so much, I'm living by myself now, I have no one here with me, except our cat that we got together. How do I deal with my emotions and feelings towards her?

Note: This is my first breakup, which is probably why it hurts so bad. Also, we've been through a lot together, she was there when my mother passed away, she was my rock, the only person I could talk to about everything.

Summer cane, we grew apart, and then came in touch again when the school year began. He was still doing the same things as before to suggest he had a crush on me and I continued reciprocation but nothing ever advanced (which I agree could be partially my fault because I am shy). Then he revealed he had a girlfriend. I didn’t ask questions about her or how long they had been together because my heart was broken. Why did he lead me on for months? It is difficult to wrap my head around it because I haven’t had much relationship experience, but I am just curious from the perspective of other men why they wouldn’t say that they are in another relationship (as to deter the other girl from catching feelings).

1989,How to recover from a long relationship,"For context, in November I, regretfully, broke up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years. I wasn’t myself for the last 4ish months of the relationship because of a lot of stress in life, and one day I popped and broke up with her.

I deeply regret this decision, but obviously she won’t get together with me. I’ve accepted that she doesn’t want me anymore, and I’ve taken all the needed steps to rebuild myself as a person. I’ve surrounded myself with friends, I’ve started therapy to help cope with my anxiety, stress, and response to those emotions, I put myself in new and uncomfortable situations all the time, I’m meditating, I’m working out, and I’m focusing a lot more on my studies. While my general mental health feels better than ever, I’m still really in pain. 

I can’t stop thinking about wanting the relationship back, and I feel like a lot of what I’m doing to better myself isn’t even for me, but it’s just in hopes of impressing my ex to get back with me. It’s always in my mind, and it’s so painful that it’s pushing me to just want to drink and other addictive tendencies that I had many years ago. 

How do I recover from this feeling, get back my sense of self, and prevent myself from using substances/drinking as a crutch?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/esdm8e/how_to_recover_from_a_long_relationship/,1579707204

I’ve been wondering a lot though... I’ve seen very few relationships stand the test of time. My parents split, my grandparents split, every aunt and uncle, most close friends I’ve had... it seems like everyone eventually gets divorced. 

It’s very discouraging to see people make the leap, trusting each other with their hearts, bodies, homes, family and finances, then fall apart.

Marriage seems like a particularly bad deal for men. Not that I’m the type to chase him down for half his stuff if it doesn’t work, but a lot of women do. And don’t get me started about the legal issues that get kids taken from their fathers. It’s heartbreaking.

So here’s my question. With all the porn and the free, no-strings attached sex available to handsome, charismatic men (like mine), and the active role society plays in striping a man of his wealth and children if things don’t work out, why do men get married?

2011,How would you feel about dating a woman who works part time because of mental health issues?,"28F with diagnosed bipolar and anxiety disorders here (the bipolar is mostly under control with meds and therapy, so it’s mainly the anxiety that’s the issue). I only work a part time job, because I get overwhelmed working too many hours. I’ve been working the same job for over 3 years now, and although the pay is low, I really love this job. I do hope to work full time someday, but I don’t feel ready yet, and to be honest, I don’t know if I ever will.

I was in a relationship for almost 5 years until last year, when my ex broke up with me. We had been talking about moving in together, but he wanted a certain lifestyle that he wouldn’t be able to afford on mostly his income. For the record, despite him making about 8x my salary, I paid for all my own meals and date activities for the whole duration of the relationship, so I’m not a leech or looking for a sugar daddy. I even paid for him occasionally, because I felt it was fair, considering he did all of the driving due to my driving anxiety. I tried to contribute to the relationship in other ways by doing thoughtful things for him, planning free or cheap dates, etc.

Weekends that I don't work (Thursday-Friday) I'm up by 8, at the gym by 9 and back home around 10. Make a big breakfast, spend a few hours studying, then figure out how we'd like to spend the weekend. Sometimes its daytrips, parties / events if there's anything going on, or a weekend trip to Toronto to visit my good friend. Most weekends we're productive-ish in the day, then as soon as its dark we like to get stupidly high and play videogames or watch a movie. Summers are similar, except I play baseball twice a week.

What I’m wondering is the flip side: guys, when you know or suspect that a female friend is into you, but you’re NOT interested like that, what do you do or say to communicate that? Do you act any differently?

Let’s assume the guy in question is interested in women and not in a relationship, because “I’m gay” or “I have a girlfriend/partner/SO” seem like obvious solutions to this problem, but they may not always apply.

I ask because as a woman, I recognize a lot of the different ways women hint or signal to men ‘just friends’ or ‘not interested,’ but I don’t know what it looks like for guys in that situation.

Edit: Please no joke answers about how this never happens because all straight men are always horny for all women. Maybe you are, but if that’s the case then this isn’t the question for you.

I really like my bf, I'm aware of how complicated a relationship with such an age gap could be and I know it has more chances of not lasting long, but I just want to enjoy things till they work. 
I know his friends and I are in different phases of life and that we don't have a ton of thing in common (e.g. they work while I study, they live on their own while I'm still at my parents house...), so it could be more difficult to become part of the group. However I want to be part of my bf's world and he wants it too, so I think it's very important to find a way to get along with his fellows and their gfs. 
When I met them I felt that on the one hand they kinda disapproved our relationship (I can understand it, I know age gap relationship have to face social disapproval), but on the other they pointed out pretty often how happier my bf seemed since we started dating.
I don't know how to behave

I'm (17F) currently dating a guy (18M) who has liked me for almost 3 years. We were classmates in 9th grade but I went to a different university after that so we haven't seen each other for more than a year and a half. 

I used to date girls before and it's my first time dating a guy. I asked him out after the new years eve and he was very excited about it. 

So basically, I was his first date and I also initiated his first kiss. I looove hugs so I hug him all the time and I like to wrap my arms around him from behind and do the awkward waddle paddle walk. I did all of the first move since he was too shy and had no dating experience.

2064,Men- why does my boyfriend make sexist jokes?,"I think he thinks they're harmless and funny. I don't get it. As far as sexist jokes go, they're pretty mild.

And other little comments in not at all serious conversations like ""this is why we shouldn't have a woman president"" and ""maybe this is just a woman thing.""

Is there is a reason for this type of humor? I don't understand.

I'm not angry, per se. It just rubs me the wrong way. Should I say something? If so, what justification do I have, because they're not really bad? Or am I being oversensitive here? Because aside from this, he basically treats me like a queen. Is it worth nit picking this?

Which pissed me off and he tried to back track but the damage was done already. 

Recently I was hooking up with this guy and he also made the same type of comment, like pointing it out, almost in a surprised way than a complimentary way. I didn’t ask “well do you like big thighs?” because frankly I doesn’t make a difference either way.  It’s not like he couldn’t see what I looked like i was wearing skinny jeans. 

For the record, im not an enormous person. Short, 5’1 size 4 pants. I work out, used to be a gymnast so yeah I have thighs.

Seems like totally legitimate reasons, but it also feels weird to ask her out to something else after it not working out these past two times, 

Unsure of how to procede, should I ask her if there is a time specifically she is available to work better around her schedule, or just leave it be.

Feels desperate to ask a chick out 3 times, but she was definitely into me when we were hanging out before. Specifically said she had a lot of fun and said we should hangout again.

I sorta just wanna be straight up and ask if shes about it, or if she changed her mind or something and doesnt want to hang out anymore, just seems like an awkward thing to say.

I understand I’ve just started working abs but they barely show up. Idk if it’s due to fat or lack of muscle from never working out.


https://imgur.com/a/drzPqTK

Here’s pics of what I have currently. As you can see, my abs some what show.

I was wondering if I continued having healthy eating habits and working my abs, if they would end up showing. I feel like I don’t have that much fat but it’s hard to tell.

For context she's a 22yo grad student and college kids aren't exactly known for their culinary expertise. What she made basically tasted like canned sauce with nothing added cuz that's what it was, with cooked meat with no spices in plain noodles with a mass of cheese and some s/p/paprika sprinkled on top you can't even taste.

Sorry if that sounds really harsh but I can't tell her that. Might immediate reaction (after prepping myself by taste testing when she wasn't in the room) was to say I need to teach her how to make sauce.

In my defense this food is inedible. I just don't know how to console her or respond to the ""everyone else likes it"" when there's no way that could be true.

so i (27F) have been casually seeing this one guy 29M for the past few weeks. first date went well and we set up a second, which went well too and ended with us sleeping together, and led to a third date that ended the same way right before the holiday season. 

holidays came and went and we've only been able to see each-other once since then and he literally just invited me over to his apartment to have sex. 🤷

no shame in that but in-between then there's been some sexting and a little bit of texting but tbh we've never texted much, only to make plans to hangout. 

what throws me off is that this guy got out of an 8+ yr relationship like 7 months before we met and i'm the first person he's been with apparently. 

so my question is — does this come off as some kind of casual thing or more of a rebound booty call thing?

I struggle to not eat out every chance I get and I'm spending way to much money on useless shit. I have no self control anymore. I masterbate once a day and think about sex way to much. I've been simping over the same girl that's terrible for me for 2+ years now. I cant get my self to consistently start working out. I'm on social media way to much. I'm sick of working customer service, some people are just so mean and dont understand I have no control over anything.I still feel like I have undiagnosed ADHD and to afraid to ask my parents to take me to the doctor for it, and I wouldn't say I'm suicidal but death is constantly on mind. I'm just done and wanna move on and do great things in this one life I got.

I’ve always been an advocate of sticking up for men who get shamed for things like this- because people should just be able to enjoy things *that don’t even cause others harm* without being mocked for it.

For example, the other day at work, me and my male coworker were talking about weekend plans, and he said he and his girlfriend were going to get pedicures together.

1 year+ into the relationship and first like for ""real"" relationship but i know in reality it isn't because of our age.
I am 20, she's 18.

Me and my girlfriend that are in long distance used to talk and call every day. 
Maybe lately I was too available for her and It probably annoyed her. She made me also lose trust, and made me like controlling and suspect her I admit it's not good any tips for that? Let me know please. 

It let to her respond slower at first, and not answer calls directly.

So I talked about it and she now suddenly tells me calling every day is not right and that she didn't want to see me every day and also she was bored and easily irritated. I told her you need space? She tells me no, I'm not taking space from relationship and tells me ""I always love you"" but i know she is also influenced by her sisters and talking about me behind my back.

She became emotionally distant.

Is she testing me to see if i can live without her?

""Remember before it all happened it came in stages and this is the aftermath""

Day 1: Almost no response 3 times maybe. And a 1 missed call of her just because i wanted but she didn't look interested. I called her later  instead and a pop up came she was in another call and she still didn't respond to my text. So I called her out, called her ""devil"" for treating me like this and then ""she"" wanted to throw a tantrum for me saying that it took her very long to reply. The next day she says I wasn't on a ""call"" later she admits she called and tells me it's not a boy or something like that but ""someone important"" childish right?. I think either she was testing me or something really happened.
On this day It took her hours to reply at certain times. Sometimes 5 or 6!!! But I didn't feel any remorse because basically it made me think she is not worth it and i accepted mentally that she isn't my girlfriend anymore. And shockingly when watching a random youtube video, and saw a girl talking and my brain said this: that's what my ""ex would think"" i said it unconsciously to myself.

So i told her why are you still behaving like that? She told me I'm not gonna break up with you and I am not seeing someone else. ""But i don't believe it"" I don't really care that much anymore, because she pushes me away. And to be honest i am more hurt for getting treated this way.

Day 2: I wasn't gonna initiate any texts anymore. We didn't even talk or something but she kept me up to date sometimes on what she was doing and more then the first day. And tells me at the end of the day, sorry that I didn't have much time for you,""I love you always"". (I got really pissed because it isn't true) but I held it in me, and told her kindly just goodnight."" She tells me I call you tomorrow. But i am not excited at all to see her and feel like ignoring or maybe worse breaking up. I know that even if she will call me, she would still be slow responsive and not call me everyday and treat me like dirt.

Conclusion:

1. She says im not taking space but she isn't putting any effort into relationship, But she tells me she isn't. Is my girlfriend trying to convince me her behaviour is normal? We used to call every day and text eachother because we are in long distance.

2. Any hope left of her behaving like she used to be? Is this a phase?

I didn't have problems with us seeing often because of the distance. But it isn't right. I cannot see the person ""i love"" but she clearly is not the same anymore.  She just told me i love you and i always do. But words is nothing, it's just words it doesn't make me feel in love or give me hope. Because of the way i get treated i find it manipulative and abusive is she abusing me?

I know it's not true what she says and how she behaves. It's like she is changing the rules for her own favour and I feel tested.

Any advice?

2313,"What's your take on this list titled ""Men, you want to treat women better? Here's a list to start with.""?","Talk to your friend who is “kind of a creep” at work.

Don’t talk over women.

If you are asked to be on a panel/team and see that it’s all men, say something. Maybe even refuse the spot!

When you see another guy talk over a woman, say: “Hey, she was saying something.”

Learn to read a fucking room.

Don’t call women “crazy” in a professional setting.

Don’t use your “feminism” as a way to get women to trust you. Show us in your day-to-day life, not in your self-congratulatory social media.

Don’t touch women you don’t know, and honestly, ask yourself why you feel the need to touch women in general.

Do you feel that any woman on earth owes you something? She doesn’t. Even if you’re like, “Hm, but what about basic respect?” ask yourself if you’ve shown her the same.

Don’t send pictures of your penis unless she just asked for them.

If a woman says no to a date, don’t ask her again.

If a woman has not given an enthusiastic “yes” to sex, back the hell off.

If a woman is really drunk, she cannot consent to you and she also cannot consent to your buddy who seems to be trying something. Your buddy is your responsibility, so say something and intervene.

If you do the right thing, don’t expect praise or payment or a pat on the back or even a “thank you from that woman”. Congratulations, you were baseline decent.

Involve women in your creative projects, then let them have equal part in them.

Don’t make misogynistic jokes.

Don’t expect women to be “nice” or “cute” and don’t get upset when they aren’t those things.

Don’t make assumptions about a woman’s intelligence, capabilities or desires based on how she dresses.

Pay women as much as you pay men.

If a woman tells you that you fucked up, and you feel like shit, don’t put it on that woman to make you feel better. Apologize without qualification and then go away.

Don’t punish women for witnessing your vulnerability.

Don’t get defensive when you get called out.

Don’t need to literally witness a man being horrible in order to believe that he’s horrible. Trust and believe women.

Don’t use your power to get women’s attention/company/sex/etc.

Be aware of your inherent power in situations and use it to protect women, especially via talking to other men.

Stop thinking that because you’re also marginalized or a survivor that you cannot inflict pain or oppress women.

If women’s pain makes you feel pain, don’t prize your pain above hers, or make that pain her problem.

Don’t read a list like this and think that most of these don’t apply to you.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/erz8z2/whats_your_take_on_this_list_titled_men_you_want/,1579633374

People have always said I have really nice hair and I’d get compliments on it all the time but I’m more than my hair. And after cutting it I feel so liberated and free and more confident for some reason. But I’m a little worried it will hinder my chances of being approached. I’m not necessarily looking. But I also am not not looking. I just don’t want it to be the reason someone doesn’t approach me. If it is, that’s their loss, I’m awesome! Lol. However, I am aware that longer hair is the golden spoon to femininity and what separates man and woman. (To most) But when you see a girl with hair above their ears what comes to mind?

I (23F)  am going out with this guy (26M) for around 3 weeks now. We've met around 5/6 times already and had sex on the second date.
He's pretty nice, handsome, sweet etc. We get along and being spending some pretty nice time together. 

I need advice with: 
1 - everytime we had sex I would not know when he cums. Like he don't say anything and also I really can't tell lol so happened some times that I am there on top (which is super often bc I really like it) and then I asked if he cum already and he says yeah? But then means we were having sex with the condom filled which is not safe and weird lol any advice of how to talk to him and any ideas of why he doesn't say anything?? 

2 - I really like some more kinky stuff like choking, slapping, hair pulling, etc etc, but he seems to be pretty vanilla on bed. The sex is good but I really miss something more rough. Would you recommend me asking him during sex (like ""pull my hair"" or ""choke me"") or maybe addressing it another moment?

In order to get it to lay back in its usual hairstyle, i have to full on wash my head with soap and hot water, dry off, and then comb it.

is there a faster/easier way to fix it? Its not really a huge deal for most mornings, I just bend over the tub or sink, or worst case scenario i'll just hop in and take a full on second shower. But it does become a problem during the warmer months when im also attempting to fix helmet hair. Or when i get that dent in it from wearing headphones all day.

But I was on a date with this girl who offered to pay, and I told her that it would be my pleasure to pay and said the cheesy line of “you can get the next one”. My order was considerably more expensive than hers so I really didn’t want her to but she just wouldn’t back down. I eventually just let her pay so there wouldn’t be a fist fight in the restaurant but fault really bad afterwards.

But i've spent these last 6 years basically being inside, i never really went out or did anything and now that im better i wanna do a lot of things, one of them is going on a date. But i am completely petrified of doing it because im afraid of being judged.

I'm 22 years old, never kissed a girl, been on a date or lived any kind of normal life because i spent all this time just battling OCD, im afraid of someone thinking its weird, i just wanted to ask any woman my age or even older from past experience, would you date someone in a situation like this? Is it weird would you be creeped out?

This has just been making me really depressed but i don't know if its my mind over-analyzing it when its not the case. I have no fear of social interaction, im just afraid of being looked at as some kind of freak...

But she very clearly likes women she has dry fucked her ex when she dating in front of me IDK what that means. She has had gfs, she liked girls but does she like men. When I ask her I she likes me she says thats how she treats her friends (not 100% on that) I love her for more than her looks and Wana make a move but I might lose my only Freind if she says no. IDK if I wouldn't kill myself (prescibed depressed not e boy depressed) I have little I'm in poverty in a town that hates me for fake Bs rumours so she is all I got. Aka If y'all fuck up I might die. If it matters I'm 11 inches taller she has been in mental hospitals for suicide attempts. We have a lot on common drawing, medical shiz, more.

2469,Are men willing to commit to a serious relationship while being a student in university?,"Me, female / mid 20s. 

I'm trying to figure out if it's something that's possible or if people are generally closed off to the idea. I yearn for a sincere relationship where you grow with your partner. I want to have a good time, learn together, build each other up, explore, laugh, cuddle, resolve differences with quality communication, bond intimately, etc. I dont want it to be superficial and temporary, I want to make an investment. I'm tired of witnessing the general population (in my age group) lack desire to be monogamous and committed. I mean, to each their own, I dont judge. It's just extremely hard finding someone who shares my desires of the real thing. Seems like most people just want to focus on themselves and not go out of their way to make things work. I'm aware I'm generalizing, this is just my anecdotal experience. 

Speaking for yourself, would you be willing to commit to someone and make it work even if it's logistically difficult? 

E.g. I'm from LA and will be in SD for 2 years and unsure where I'll end up after. If I'm in a genuine relationship, I would be willing to make it work and compromise where my partner and I lived. Is that not the common consensus? Do people just want to study with their heads down and/or have casual flings and date when they're more settled? If you find something worth fighting for, would you choose not to?

I maintain excellent grades and am able to commit without dragging anyone down, including myself. Do people fear a relationship would jeopardize their education?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ersfgf/are_men_willing_to_commit_to_a_serious/,1579599993

2475,How do I deal with my first big heartbreak?,"I've been talking to this girl for about 4 months, we pretty much clicked instantly and got to know each other really well and honestly I think I fell in love. On New Years I asked her out and she said yes, we continued to date and it was kind of long distance (she lived about 2 hours away from I did, but that didn't stop me from seeing her as much as possible) which made things a little difficult at times. I even changed my mind about which university I wanted to go to just so that I could be closer to her. Unfortunately she's recently had a hard time adjusting to her life as we've both just finished High School and are getting ready to pursue a career or continue studying at a university. 
This hardship has pushed her to the point of breaking up with me, despite all that I've said to ease her and attempt to look for a different solution she's decided it's best that she stays single for now. I understand it may be what she needs and I don't wish her any hardship because I can see the problem from her side of the coin as well as my own. What I don't understand is why I feel so bad, like I've been pushed around and fucked over. I really liked this girl, and it wasn't like any of my previous relationships, this girl was special. Unfortunately she's a bit stubborn like me so she won't be getting back together with me until she stitches her life back together.
She's stated that I haven't lost her and that she wishes to try again when all is well. As much as I like her I'm not too sure about this idea, I feel like if we got back together in say 6 months it would be awkward and it wouldn't work as well as it has this first time.

Men of reddit, what do I do? I'm now stuck in a university I only chose because of her, I can't stop thinking about her and breaking down and I'm not sure about getting back together after a break, despite my feelings for her.

And my issue is this, some people in this sub ask for advice and all. That's great and all. But then I found some thread with the title ""The common lies in this sub"". I agreed with some comments like when some dude say I have big dick or how many woman he gets. But what pisses me off is they categorized as lies the advice that some people gave to them. Like realtionship advice and advice on life, they just shit on that. Like saying ""relationship is like a straight line, but it's damn hard"", or saying ""those dudes who give advice like they have it figured it out"".

That kinda stuff is grinding my gears, some people want to give a helping hand, tried their best to help other but some are just whiny little shit who just keep complaining. 

Another one I found on another sub with this quesion""What is the point of life when you're not rich"". Many other people tried their best to help this dude. Because he may had some issues, but guess what he just kept saying that their advice was shit and all. You may have a bad day, but that stuff is messed up. People want to genuinely help but nope, this dude just want to complain about life. WHy in the first place did you put this question? It's so stupid and assholish to just begin a thread and just shitting on people advice. 

Life is not supposed to be easy, it's not damn fair, but you have to work hard to own it. I was the kinda who kept complaining like those dudes. But then I stopped complaining, worked hard and it was painful but in the end it was wort it. The stuff like get your shit together, egt over yourself can grind your gears but it's a fact that it will help you. 

Anyway I know that I will always see other tread with people complaining. I will always try to help but sometimes I understand why some people say 'just leave the depress people alone"".

2500,How to deal with my best friend moving away,"My best friend is leaving soon to go to Mexico for a study abroad trip, and I just said goodbye to him tonight until the next time I see him in June. I haven’t been handling it very well. He’s my smoking buddy, movie-watching buddy, 3AM trip to the grocery store buddy, and I’m gonna lose all of that for 5 months. I have other good friends here at college, so it’s not like I’ll be entirely alone, but I worry that not having him around is something I won’t be able to get over. Luckily, the silver lining in all of this is that him leaving will make me focus really hard on school, which is important for me with it being my first semester of nursing school. I’ll smoke way less, probably eat healthier, and hopefully focus more on school. I know that it’s for the best because it’s important to him. He feels like living in the US sucks (and frankly it kinda does) and he thinks his life is just gonna be fucking incredible when he lives there. He mentioned to me last night when we had dinner at one of our favorite places for the last time that if he loves it when he’s down there, he’s considering staying down there permanently. Obviously I’d love for him to get to live a better life, but I know mine would be really hard without him. I know I’m probably being a little bitch for getting upset about my friend leaving for only a few months, but it’s torn me down today.

I'm a 19 year old girl and I'm south-east asian. I dress modestly and am quiet religious. I try to limit my interactions with guys and lead a righteous lifestyle.

However, I can't help how I look or how my body looks. I have tan skin, black hair, and a pretty curvy figure. This has made guys refer to me as Mia Khalifa since 9th grade. As someone who is devoted to being modest, this reality made me really depressed in the past

I even changed schools, attending three different high schools but this harassment and nickname continued to follow me. I now attend college and still get harassed. I always attract the wrong attention and the wrong guys no matter how modestly I dress.

I tried cutting my hair and getting contact lenses to change my look but it has done nothing. Girls sometimes spread rumors about me just because of my shape also. 

I get cat called and have been in rather dangerous situations with guys following me home or crowding me. How can I get guys to stop harassing me? Why am I always such an easy target?

2511,I’ve been blocked by my ex-girlfriend for about a week now. Should I stop wasting my time? She may be manipulative.,"I (24M) met her (23) during college (through Tinder). She started her graduate studies in Neuroscience for a PhD, and I was finishing up my undergraduate studies for computer science (just graduated). The first time I met her, we were getting to know each other and it was a blast: we had so much in common, she was intelligent, funny, and beautiful. About a week in, we started hooking up. And a week later, she asked me if I am her boyfriend, and I said yes. But there were multiple major red flags diving deep into the relationship.


Red flags: she told me that she had been contacting her long term ex-boyfriend as a friend and seemingly hasn’t moved on from him (he’s about 300 miles away from our college town), she always hides her phone screen from me whenever I’m near her presence, and one of my friends found her Tinder profile still up 7 weeks into dating her..

So by the time it was almost finals and the semester was about to end, the day before her birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to tag her in a “In a Relationship” status just to surprise her. I mean, 8 weeks into dating and we were working on something together, so I felt it was the right time. This backfired, and she told me that she likes to keep her private life “private”. She then had to explain to her friends, family, Mom, and ex about me. I apologized and tried to explain that it was a mistake, but she replied by blocking me on Facebook (probably to hide any ties with her)

I thought this was odd. A week after this conundrum, we spent some time together in her apartment, and while we were getting ready for bed, she asked me to give her her phone downstairs. I thought to myself that this was the moment I get to know the truth. I started snooping (unacceptable, but necessary) her messages and I found a text message from a guy who asked if she’s down for dinner while we were dating. She didn’t respond to him (or she probably deleted her responses), but I confronted her about it. She then said to me “if you think I’m cheating on you, you should leave”. She then broke down, and I said it’s okay, trying to calm her down since she was having panic attacks

The next early morning while she was sleeping, things didn’t add up to me, so I managed to snoop her phone again. This time, I found out she’s been in contact with multiple guys in the area through text (comprising of when she’s available in the evenings) and her matching on Tinder (no flirtatious messages). But the worst of it all, her text message to her ex boyfriend made my heart palpitate. She explained to him that the “In a Relationship” status was fake, claiming that I “was a graduate student who wanted her attention and stalk her or something”. Then her ex suggested to talk shit about me if she had any mutual friends

I confronted her about it, she threatened to call the police on me but she cried and tried to explain her innocence , and I naively forgave her.

So the next day, I sent her an essay of wanting to break up with her going along the lines of “I’m breaking up with you. You’re cheating on me, and I want my things back”
She said in reply “Thank you for all the bullshit assumptions and for saying I love you about an hour ago, was that just to play with my emotions? Nice to know literally everything wanting to be with me meant nothing. Goodbye, OP”
She then explained to me that she uses Tinder because she’s conceited and prideful, that she uses for attention.
I then, out of misery, said that I still love her. And she replied back with “And I still love you”

We then agreed to keep each other as “friends for now” the following day because we obviously have strong feelings for each other. 

So after graduation and during Christmas break, I burned a lot of bridges and crossed boundaries from our “break”. I sent her an essay demanding for reciprocal love during her time in work, instead of calling her I showed up unexpectedly to her apartment to ask if she’s moving on (and to get my things back), and my phone call conversations always consisted of me asking her if she still loves me and everything. Then I accused her that “I know you’ve moved on” after I found her Tinder profile 8 days ago. She said in reply that my accusations are narrative, that I am putting her on edge all of the time, and that she dearly loved me. And this caused her to block me partially everywhere. After realizing I’ve been blocked on my phone, I frantically started freaking out and was delirious. I managed to contact her via email, asking for a way to elaborate and clarify that I still trust her. She then sent me the following email:  

“I’m sorry, I literally don’t know what else to do. I’m just sitting here crying and I can’t keep doing this. I feel like you keep me on edge all of the time because I never know what you might do or say. You take narratives and run with them. I start my classes tomorrow morning and I don’t think it would be helpful if we talked right now, but I also don’t think it would be helpful in general if we were talking at all for the time being. Please understand. I’m so sorry, I don’t know how to handle this. I think you are an awesome, amazing person and I would like to talk again, but stuff like this keeps happening and it’s not okay. This hurts me so much, and I know it must hurt you too, but I think it's for the best. You will always be in my heart. Please take care of yourself and be safe. Don't isolate yourself. Talk with your friends and relatives. I'm going to get better too and everything will be okay. Maybe in the future we can talk again, I don't know, but I do know that I need to be okay first.”

I then replied her that I’ll respect her well-being, that I agree that this is probably the best for both of us, and that I dearly loved her and I’m sorry that I’ve been a shitty guy. 

Shen then told me “I appreciate that. Also, I don’t think you’re a shitty guy so please don’t beat yourself up over anything. Thank you for understanding.”

I can’t get over her. It felt like our love was real. But, I don’t even know anymore. I don’t even think I can trust anyone like her as well.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/erq9yj/ive_been_blocked_by_my_exgirlfriend_for_about_a/,1579585496

I'm (21f) in a long distance relationship of two years with my boyfriend (22), lately he has been odd, not distance but not super lovey dovey which is fine. But after nagging him to look at his syllabus which he just got about six days ago to see when he can come see me he finally did. He was suppose to come see me this coming month but claims he is too busy and it will have to be March. I just suggest that I can come see him then. He then said he didn't want to do that because he would have almost no time to spend with me and if we are going to spend all that money and time and effort then he wants it to be when he can actually spend time with me. I don't care, just seeing him and being next to him is good enough for me, at least at night I'll be able to hold him and be close to him. I understand this is a busy semester for him, but he can almost never answer my calls and I'm always waiting for him to call. Again I'm fine with that but what makes me upset is that he doesn't say anything that sweet or sincere or does anything to make me feel loved. I try to communicate how I feel and ask him to just be affectionate and he says okay but nothing really changes. He almost seems like he isn't as in love with me as he use to.  I understand he is busy but something feels off. I know he doesn't want to break up, I actually almost broke up with him because it was so bad I didn't think he was as interested as he use to be. I use to get ""you're so pretty"" or ""you make me happy' or just sweet little things that like that even when he is busy  But now nothing.

He lifts like 10-15lbs more than me. he “can lift heavier but isn’t feeling it today” (his own words). he is constantly making excuses when he can’t lift something or if i lift the same as him. example: i benched the same weight and reps as him but he says “well it’s easier for you because i have longer arms so it’s harder for me to go all the way down with the weight”. he always makes subtle comments about me being “little” and “weak”. like today i was about to bench and he goes “hurry up with that little ass bird chest”. one of the guys in the group was squatting just over 500lbs and the dude i’m talking about goes “our whole group could probably squat that, well except [my name] he’s just too small and weak for that”. yet he squats the same weight as me.

i got on the scale and it was 161lbs, and he goes “dude you are so small. how are you only 160”. one of the other guys backed me up and said that was a good weight for me and saying that i’m putting on size. then the other guy was like “yeah but he’s not swole like me”. i’m tired of this clown talking shit so i said “sorry i’m not fat like you. you need to loose a lot of weight then you can come talk to me”. then he got all pissed. then one of the guys was talking about what they were having for dinner and this dude goes “yeah you need to get out of here and go eat too with your small ass”. so i told him he needs to go home and skip a few meals for a weak and maybe he will loose some weight. Then he got all mad again and tried getting in my face. this dude has been talking shit for months but when i finally stand up for myself he can’t handle it and gets butthurt.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/erpntn/how_to_deal_with_someone_that_is_super_cocky_and/,1579582053

When I asked her out, we were only the same team.  But recently, I was promoted and became her manager.  She doesn't seem too happy about it.  I am not interested in her anymore but I still try to be friendly.  I try to say good morning and good-bye.  I tried to make chit chat but she's giving me the cold shoulder every time.  I am not saying she has to be my friend but her attitude is causing the work environment to be very awkward and unpleasant to work in.  It's easy to say just keep things professional and only focus on work related tasks but it's not that simple.  I feel her motivation will drop because of this environment and why have such a tense work environment when it doesn't seem to benefit anyone?  I tried having a 1-on-1 meeting with her, just to know her better and get to know more about her work and her goals just like any good manager would, but she only gave one word answer.

Is there anything I can do at this point?  I thought about just having a frank 1-on-1 discussion about the awkwardness but I feel she's going to deny any wrongdoing on her part.

Both never cheated, no major fights, passion didnt die, nothing. we were SO not perfect of course, and each had our bad days, but in all honestly, we were so equal and really connected on a deep level.  

No issues, no signs, no lack of intimacy, nothing. he woke up after an amazing night out, and said he wants to be alone. He said he envisions his life alone.  I am so broken- i wrote him a letter, then we saw each other 2 weeks later. I asked what happened, what did i do, what made him lose interest, and he said it has nothing to do with me, and that he genuinely wants to be alone and doesn’t want to be with anyone. wants to be alone more than he loves me.  (he doesnt have social media, he isn’t a go to a bar n screw kinda guy (nothing against those guys!) he has always kept to himself and does his own thing. (if hes bangin 10 ppl right now, more power to him lol)  

his ACTIONS spoke so much louder than his words- he showed me nothing but love, he was asking me what trip i wanted to go on, what color to paint his bathroom, and getting me stuff for his house that i liked. Days before. Never once did I feel not secure, in 5 years.  again, we were not perfect, but it was so healthy and equal. 

We havent spoke in 2 months. I love him more than anything and am trying my best to respect his space, not reach out or anything.  I dont know what to do or think. There are of course 100 other variables to this, but I am being honest when i say there is nothing that stands out to me, and he is just like “i just want to be alone now”.    I know he is okay, meaning we have mutual friends and he is “okay” like going to work hanging out etc. I dont think i will reach out. I want to respect him, i hope he doesnt resent me for not reaching out. I hope he doesnt think “oh well, she didnt text me on my bday so, im not even going to bother texting her” or whatever. 

Why be alone when he was so happy with me? Why not even BRING UP what was bothering him? “hey, im concerned about xyz, can we talk about it?”  I was just left, and had zero say. Discarded like im nothing.

2585,How should you help your best friend with heartbreak,"For context, one of my best friends is a poor starving artist who's trying to make it in life. We decided that we would open up a company together. He has pretty low self-esteem as his family has never treated him right and always treated him like a failure for being a poor starving artist. He never really had the greatest grades in school and has been pretty down on his luck his whole life and it doesn't help that we've known each other for most of our lives and I've always been relatively successful in most of my endeavors like school and stuff and so he has always had his family compare him to me (which was not my intention at all. I just have a strict family, so I had to do well), but he's a genuinely nice guy and has helped me out many times.

So my best friend fell in love with a girl, but the girl decided to end their relationship after kinda playing around with his heart. He's been pretty devastated and has been down on his luck this whole time. He talked to me about his self-worth and how he felt himself growing older and not having much success in life and how he has always felt like a failure and how the girl playing with him made him feel worthless as though there was nothing good nor talented about him. It's an odd thing; even if he's my best friend and not family, his pain felt as if it were my pain, almost as though the girl had played with me instead of him. I didn't know exactly how to help with it, so I told him what I personally thought about relationships myself. I personally believe that relationships are there to test compatibility and that it's better to test them sooner rather than later, however I felt that it was a crummy - perhaps too logical answer, and don't believe I helped cheer him up. So I I said that I would be there for him and that if he needed me I would talk. I'm not sure what else I can do about it but it's painful seeing him so down when I know he's got immense talent within himself even if no one else thinks he does.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/eroa62/how_should_you_help_your_best_friend_with/,1579574935

2587,Bf broke up but wants to be friends?,"
When we broke up he said he didn’t want to end on a bad note and that he still wants me in his life, just as a friend. He briefly offered we could just take a break but I was just like if you want to break up than we’ll break up and he didn’t press it further
He said the reason he wanted to break up was I flirted with a guy several months ago and while he’s been trying to trust me it’s been really hard (especially since I’m in the military so I’m away from him surrounded by a bunch of guys several days a month)
Any thoughts on this?
I read a psychology article awhile back that said if exes are friends after a breakup they’re either still in love or never were... and I was definitely in love with him and he was always good to me...

We still text each other asking how each other’s days were and if we’re okay etc etc but I don’t want to stay friends with him if he’s just keeping me in his life as a type of side chick even though he’s not that kind of guy...

2588,Does he like me or am i overreacting?,"I bumped into this guy who i went to hs with at the airport. We’ll call him Drew. We never really talked before but we did have mutual friends. Anyway, we both had some small talk and found out that we were both heading to Hawaii on the same flight. During this time I was pregnant and meeting my boyfriend in Hawaii while Drew was meeting up with his parents. Not only were we on the same flight but we were actually seated together! At the time, I was annoyed cause I’m pregnant and I was hoping to catch some sleep. We ended up talking the whole flight (5 hours). I kept the conversation going because I hate awkward silence. Anyway, people around us would congratulate us thinking that we were a couple but before i could correct them, he went along with it by thanking people. I thought it was innocent jokes so i didnt care. 

After the flight, he texted me saying that he still couldn’t believe that we were seated next to each other and claimed it was “fate”. 

A month later I find out that we were both taking the same online college course. I had just given birth so I have a family. Over the course of the semester he texted me everyday talking about his family, what he was doing, and even about his bio mom abandoning him. Our conversations would go on the whole day until 2am. Im up at this time of course cause I have a newborn. I just thought he needed a friend to rant to. Didn’t think too much of it. 

He would ask for pictures of my daughter saying that shes so cute and getting so big and that he couldn’t wait to meet her. 

One day he called me huffing and puffing about how this guy he was supposed to get tattooed from flaked on his appointment. Drew wanted to go to this guys house and fight or whatever. I tried to calm him down. He txted me after thanking me. 

It was friendly up until the point where he sent me pictures of his new tattoo on his chest and his neck. I talked to my bf about it and he thinks that drew likes me.  

If that’s the case, I want to set boundaries but in a polite way!

I usually stuck to exclusively body weight exercises but since my parents started supporting me getting into better shape, I’ve been expanding on the range of what I try and do. 

My mother, who has never even been in a gym and is overweight, suggested picking up some weights at a local place. 

So I got a pair of 5LBs and a pair of 10LBs. 

Then my dad (who worked out twice a week over 20 years ago) told me that at 18 I should be lifting atleast 40-50 LB and working towards a minimum of 70LB. Per arm. 

To be honest, I’m actually stronger than I expected myself to be and 10LB is feeling not light but I can barely notice the weight and it takes very little to no effort to do anything with them.

2600,How does a guy struggling with his finances explains his situation to a new date?,"I have been lurking for a while and this is something that I keep thinking about when it comes to start a new relationship.  I'm a middle aged man, never married but with a young kid from a previous relationship; I have a good job and I'm working hard to try to get a promotion and improve my professional prospect, but due to very questionable financial decision in the past I am barely surviving.

I'm working really hard to get my finances in order and I'm proud of the fact that I paid of one loan and will take care of two (or possibly three) this year; things are looking up but besides the times I spend with my kid I'm mostly alone because I think I can't afford dating.

My last girlfriend and I broke up because we couldn't talk about money; we were both middle aged parents with young kids, but she thought I was ""cheap"" even though I paid for most of our dates.  We enjoyed our time together and got along well with each other kids, but we were both  struggling financially and had diametrically opposite approach to money management.

After that experience I put even more urgency on getting a good grip on my finances; I cut my expenses even more, cut my 401k contributions to the minimum... but mostly spend my free time at home watching TV or reading.   That was depressing (and I struggled with depression for a long time when I was younger) so I updated my dating profile and starting swiping left and right.

Well, a couple of weeks ago a very attractive middle aged divorcee liked what she saw and contacted me; we had a nice conversation and ended up exchanging numbers.  I called her yesterday and agree on going on a date on Friday and I really need your advice on how to approach this situation if we get serious.

I know I shouldn't left past experiences mess up new ones and I know that if a woman tells me that I'm cheap for whatever reason that's a red flag that can't be ignored.   Also important to mention because I think is relevant is that I'm an immigrant to the USA and in my culture the man always pays for everything and even though I'm very assimilated I feel really ashamed to let a lady pay for half the bill when we go out....which is silly, because even my last ex actually paid for some dates herself.

I feel like I'm rambling and I don't even know if I have good long term prospect with this lady, but for the future: how should I go about regarding my finances and dating?

2602,How to proceed with gym crush,"We’ve been going to the same gym for quite a while, but I’ve only noticed in the last couple of months that he’d stare at me. At first, I thought this was maybe by chance, but then it happened too often so I figured there was more to it.  I did one of those smile nod things to him a few times and he’d keep staring. So naturally, I started paying more attention. He would often look over at me from afar and glance over. If I looked back, he’d look away and that happens quite a bit. When we walk passed each other, he wouldn’t make eye contact. Then, in the last week, I noticed he’d actually put his head down when he’d see me approaching from afar, and turn his head away. I asked him last week if he was using these weights by him, and when he saw me approach, he put his head down and just nodded no without speaking or looking up.  I also feel like he’s on nearby machines often or just generally in the same area, but that could also be coincidence. 

I went back and forth on whether I should even say hi.  It seemed like I made him slightly uncomfortable if he can’t make eye contact. Plus, I certainly don’t feel/look that attractive in the gym. Then today, he was getting spotted by my friend so I thought in the least this could make for good conversation.  He was at the machine next to me at the end of my workout, so I finally got the courage to introduce myself. He was super nice and actually not really shy at all.  We talked about our workout for the day and where we’re from in the area and so forth. He even said he noticed how much I can lift and called me strong (which in the least makes me think he wants me to know he’s looked over?).  I said I hope it wasn’t weird that I came up to him and he said he was glad I did and it wasn’t since we see each other practically every weekday. We talked for like 5 minutes and he was actually the one who kept trying to talk more. We shook hands and said we’d see each other tomorrow. 

So I’m just really bad at reading signs, but it kind of seems like he may be interested as well? I want to see how the conversation goes for this week and if we actually do more than just wave, then maybe I’d ask him by the end of the week if he wants to grab a coffee sometime. Should I wait longer than that? Should I try to gauge how interested he actually is/isn’t since we just spoke for the first time? TIA!

Just mostly small talk and chatting about music and weed. She found me on Instagram within a week and we started following each other. I was pretty stoked about that for some reason. Anyway, we continued chatting on tinder and I casually asked her to go out a few times and she avoided the question twice and said ""probably not tonight"" the next...I was specifically asking her to hang out a week in advance. Around mid December I was getting very frustrated putting effort into meeting this girl because it felt like she kept casually avoiding my question to hang. Her being the only girl I was chatting with on tinder I messaged her and said ""hey I need to take a break from tinder"". She said ""no worries"" and added me on Facebook a week later and pmd me and said ""tinder is dumb lol"". I've casually kept in touch trying to get her to hang still but she's still avoiding it. I really have no idea why I have a big crush on this girl but I do. I feel like she wouldn't of added me if she wasn't interested but who knows...I haven't deleted her but I unfollowed her of IG and FB because when I see her face I get sad and stuff :( I know this sounds lame but I feel like she secretly enjoys making me suffer.

We went on one date, and he said he wanted to do it again. We've been talking every night since. He's a bit awkward though. He was homeschooled, never had a GF and I'm pretty sure he's a virgin. I'm not. But I don't mind any of that. 

I can't guage if he's too awkward/ oblivious to my advances. I've been lightly flirting with him. But I don't really get anything back. So I don't know if he's not into it. Or, if he's just inexperienced with flirting. He said that he's bad and flirting and often can't tell.

So I guess, what do I do now? Do I come on stronger and maybe make a fool of myself? Or back off and stay as friends (which I'm also happy to do, he's a cool guy, I don't mind either way).

2651,How can I clean up mold after a flood in my basement?," Hey all,

So two weeks ago our basement flooded, luckily the basement is unfinished and nothing of value was damage. Now my main concern was once I cleaned up the water, the flood had white fluffy mold growing as the floor was drying. I had a fan and a dehumidifier running the whole time yet mold still formed. This last weekend I ripped up the large area rug that was now garbage and tried to mop the floor with cleaner thinking that would get rid of the mold.... nope. Once the mop water started to dry new mold started forming, same white fluffy stuff as before. Now my main concern is my pregnant girlfriend (she doesn't go in the basement) and my cats as their litter box is in the basement. How can I clean the cement floor without mold growing? I'm in Canada and opening basement windows is not an option to help air out the basement.

My (24F) boyfriend (23M) and I have been together for a little over two years now and I feel like I am the cause for our lack of passion. After recovering from a very traumatic and abusive divorce on my side, we met one another soon after while I was admittedly still healing. I have a son from my previous marriage and we are currently expecting another seedling together. He has completely and wholeheartedly put himself into and accepted the role of being my sons father (birth father is not involved whatsoever), and he is over the moon excited for our little one brewing. I started going to therapy after my marriage concluded and was eventually diagnosed with depression and anxiety. He was there (in my life) for my diagnosis, me first getting on meds, and me being medicated. He has stuck through it all and has endured me and all my baggage. My issue is this-I was a bitch. I was and am still learning to deal with jealousy, anxiety, insecurity, depression, PTSD, and now that I am pregnant, I’ve had to halt all my previously prescribed meds. I feel like all of this has caused him to harden to me a little and become less...in love with me. I know he loves me and our family, but I just feel like I don’t make his eyes glimmer like I used to, and I do not want to lose him. I am realizing the fault in my ways and I want to be better. I still go to therapy and am still healing. We still have sex regularly, maybe 2-3 times a week, definitely not as much as we used to, but I want the connection we used to share. I get glimmers every once in a while but it doesn’t last. What are some ways that I can whoo him again? Or remind him why we fell in love? Maybe little steps I can take towards growth?

I’m not only just looking at pictures of women and celebrities, I look at other things besides that, I don’t even have the nsfw enabled.

During the sexy sexy times when we're getting into it, I do ask him or tell him I'd love his mouth to be down there, but he just doesn't do it. I didn't think my vagina looked ugly but I'm starting to worry about it? He's quite shy and quiet so I don't know if maybe he's just not too confident in that respect but he just kinda shrugs it off.

So we were renting hotels for a weekend vacation in Seaside NJ, a beach town where you go to party and drink on the boardwalk and stuff. I had my own room because I was single. My friend's gf texts me saying ""Good news! My friend R thinks you're cute. She  wants wants to come with us and stay in your room."" My friend texted me on the side telling me she basically was said without saying that she wanted to fuck. I'm ecstatic at this point. I tell her send the pic. Gentlemen, only way I could have been less interested is if she were a dude. So I'm thinking how do I get out of this, since I'll inevitably meet this girl. It must have been a half hr of me deliberating. My friend is texting me like ""Yo my gf and her friend are waiting. What's up?"" So eventually I texted something like ""Thanks but I'm fine.""                                     It gets better. A week later, that same friend's gf throws a small watch party for Mayweather McGregor I (cuz we know II is inevitable.) I walk in, and sitting at the table is R who I rejected, and a new girl, A. A is gorgeous and I'm instantly infatuated. I start chatting her up immediately. Finally I ask my friend's gf ""Yo, what's up with A? She single?"" Turns out she's the best friend of R, who I basically rejected on sight.

2821,My life-long best friend wants to date me.,"I’ve known my best friend since we were kids, we grew up together, then he moved away but visited every summer vacation. He was the first guy I kissed and dated. First time in 7th grade, it went wrong (he liked a friend of mine and kinda dumped me), then in 10th grade (same thing + he was having drug issues and was all over the place and screamed at me and locked me up in a room).

I stopped talking to him after the 2nd dating attempt, he got sober and 2 years later apologised for being such an asshole until I forgave him and we became friends again.

Then once a year or so he asked for another chance to be with me. I always said “no” because I never wanted to get hurt again + he was always judgemental of who I was dating and was always asking for a new chance only after his relationships were failing. He had this romantic idea that we should be together bc we knew each other since we were in diapers. But it felt like a desperate last resort option. I never felt like a priority.

That happened for years until I introduced him to a colleague of mine, 4-5 years ago, and he basically married her after a couple of months of dating. I made up some excuse and did not go to the wedding - I couldnt believe he was so nice with her and with me he never had been, despite me always being there for him. He got upset and we didnt talk for a year, but then we reconnected again and were best friends again. I even visited him and his wife and I was happy for him. He was an emotional wreck before her, had alcohol problems and then he became like the best version of himself. So I understood her personality brought out the best in him and I was trully happy for him.

He was sometimes rubbing it in my face that he could have married me instead, but apart from this, it all seemed awesome until they had a baby and he told me he was cheating on his wife. He said they were not having sex and this was an arrangement they had made.

At the same time, we spent an evening together watching a movie and all of a sudden I started feeling things for him, which totally freaked me out because I had never had any romantic feelings for years for him.  Plus I was seeing someone else. I basically ran away from his flat in the middle of the night. I told him about my feelings and we decided to just move on.

At the baptism of his kid he was super strange - totally ignored me. We still hanged out whenever he visited (we live in different places).Then he called me to wish me a happy NY - which he never does and told me he got a divorce. I was shocked, he seemed so happy with his wife, only mentioned she is bad with money, but nothing more. 

We hanged out and stayed up late drinking and talking. He told me everything about the marriage. And then - AGAIN, hinted at us being together. Told me he doesnt feel as close as he is to me with nobody else and that he had been separated from his wife, but they had kept it private since she was pregnant (so the night we watched the movie and got close he was not with her anymore).

It got me thinking. Should I give this a chance if we happen to both be single at the same time? I am physically atttracted to him, I love him a lot, what happened happened in our teens, now we are in our thirties. But I still have this feeling that he wants more the idea of me and a romantic dream than who I am. And that no matter how convincing he may sound, I should stay the fuck away. All his relationships ended within 4 years time. They all started and ended the same. And he never wanted to go to therapy or do some soul searching.  Just partied until the next one, then got sober again and so on.Now he is still seeing the girl he cheated on with because she totally adores him and he hates being alone. Which I kinda get but I dont know... it feels selfish. And I dont like the way he treats her. Most of the time he is nice to her, but he sometimes treated her like a servant. Or like she is stupid... not ok. She is also much younger than us. 

TL;DR: Should I date my best friend? We’re in our thirties, been friends since we were born, through many ups and down, but I dont feel I can trust him.",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/erf4wv/my_lifelong_best_friend_wants_to_date_me/,1579536325

2840,How much does your mindset affect your view of yourself?,"Before I start, I'll preface this by saying I understand that it could be considered vein to care about one's appearance, and that I should just 'get over it' or 'stop giving a \*\*\*'. I'm just looking for some input from other men who may have gone through something similar.

**Onto my post...**

Over the past year, I have made inconsistent but effective changes in my life to try and address certain faults within myself. I have made significant progress when looking back at how I was this time last year. 

I've completely overcome a habitual addiction that had been destroying me for the last 2 years. I've grown socially and emotionally, and I've been working on my self image and how I present myself.

I still have a long way to go, but i'm making progress, slowly but surely.

One of the things I seem to be stuck on is my physical appearance. I've been told i'm good looking and had interest from women. But I can't accept it. I have major insecurities with my looks, and they have always affected my confidence. So much that until last year, when i turned 21, I never let myself entertain the idea of having a romantic partner, Instead I convinced myself that I actually didn't desire any romantic relationships. (when in reality, I was just trying to suppress my worries that I'm not good enough to have one).

**Now onto the main point of my post...**

I noticed that some days, when I look in a mirror, I think I look hideous, and my mood is then affected for the rest of the day. But I noticed that when I'm having a good day, have taken care of myself and my responsibilities, when I look at myself, I see myself as a decently attractive guy. My smile looks better, eyes look more lively, hair seems nicer, my figure even looks improved.

Does having a negative mindset really reflect how you see yourself to that extent? Could most of my worries and insecurities be fed by my negativity and self loathing, which in turn actually makes things seem worse than they really are?

I'm just trying to understand how my opinion of myself can vary so much, all depending on what my current mindset is.

If anyone has any similar experiences, or reading material that could help me understand this situation, I'd really appreciate it. Feels like I'm a bit stuck trying to figure this out.

What really annoyed me was that he said he could only meet between 3-11pm because he had to go home to watch a UFC game (this is a Saturday btw) and he almost took it for granted that I should go to him. Idk I would feel bad if I’m making a guy travel even 40 minutes and would try to accommodate if someone traveled that far but I didn’t sense that kind of courtesy from him. I expressed that I didn’t want to go in this weather and why it felt rude of him to ask me to do that. He said he understood and then said “why don’t I plan something next time so it doesn’t inconvenience you?” I declined because the first impression was a bit too much and it didn’t feel like he was apologetic or even realized he was asking too much. He got annoyed saying “I wouldn’t run to conclusions or make ultimatums if I were you.” So where should the line be drawn?

2868,Can you really be platonic friends with someone you slept with and is it ok to hang out with them when you now are with someone else?,"So, I’ve known my boyfriend since August 2018, we’ve dated a few times in the past but this time it’s not casual and we’ve been together for 3 months. When we first met we’d both just gotten out of serious relationships where we’d had our hearts broken. 

He met F around September 2018 and they had a short casual fling and remained friends. I was a little jealous of her (never met her and personally don’t think she’s attractive but he obviously did). So they’ve not been in a relationship and they haven’t (as far as I’m aware) had a sexual encounter for over a year. In that time we dated for a few months but it wasn’t good timing as we both were still messed up from the serious relationships, and then he dated someone else entirely for four months. So I knew he was still friends with F and didn’t care much until we started dating again towards the end of last year. We got back together because it was a better time for us both and the feelings never faded. 

We told each other we love each other, a big deal for us both having only said it in serious relationships before. I brought up F for some reason and he told me he wishes they never had a sexual relationship because they’re really good friends and she helped him through his break up and he values her friendship. Fine, not ideal as I have no experience with guys having female friends they’ve got a history with, but I have to accept it. 

Anyway, I have a history of overthinking and he knows this. He’s always been completely honest about something if I ask him a question, which i really appreciate but I found out from a Facebook post that she tagged him in that he’d been at hers in the last few months. I asked him about it calmly and he said ‘yeah, I was there around November I think?’ And I asked why he hadn’t told me before or if he lied about it and he said ‘I didn’t lie, I just didn’t mention it. It didn’t come up, I don’t tell you every time I hang out with the boys and I didn’t want you to over think’ but that’s really upset me. He said he realises he should have told me (in fairness i think it was before we told each other how we felt and before things became more serious where were now talking about a future together) and that in future he will mention it just so I feel included and know that he’s not being shady or hiding anything. 

I genuinely believe from his point of view that there’s no feelings there, if there was then he’s had the past year to start things up again. However, he told me that she’s made it clear she’s interested in him by asking if we’re still together and when he said yes she’s responded by saying ‘damn’ (this, as far as I know, was after they last hung out, I think she said this recently). 

I mean, in general guys is normal to hang out with a girl you’ve slept with but have no feelings or attraction to, one on one? They hung out at her house and had a takeaway and watched a film. I just can’t wrap my head around this and don’t want to be naive but at the same time I’ve never had a boyfriend who’s had female friends he actually hangs out with like that, and I don’t have guy friends that I hang out with alone regularly if that makes sense. 

I don’t want to make him feel like he can’t be her friend, I don’t want to be controlling or anything. But I’m uncomfortable with them having out again knowing now that she still likes him and quite frankly, I just don’t get it. I don’t see why they would need to meet up and hang out and do what we do minus the sex when he has me?

Can you help me to understand a different perspective please? 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend is friends with someone he had a casual sexual fling with over a year ago and they sometimes hang out alone.

I’m wondering if anyone has any tips on becoming more masculine? 
I’ve constantly been mistaken for gay my entire teenage life. I’m almost 19 and have never had a girlfriend. 
I’m not sure what it is about me that makes me seem gay, I guess I subconsciously act in a feminine way. I think I may make quick movements while interacting with people. For example, if I were sitting down somewhere and someone come up next to me and said hello, I would quickly turn my neck to them subconsciously. Is stuff like that a feminine trait? 
I don’t have a gay voice, I’ve always been told it’s deep. I think a contributing factor to my femininity is the fact that I was raised by women primarily, my mother and my grandmother. My father died when I was very young, and thus I didn’t grow up with much of a masculine role model. 

Please suggest some tips on how I can become more masculine? What are some typically feminine mannerisms guys use that make them seem gay?",AskMen,/r/AskMen/comments/ercaxr/im_not_sure_why_i_come_across_femininegay/,1579521367

We used to text each other all the time and even hangout by ourselves occasionally but I was always too afraid to make a move. I always wonder if it was due to my insecurity and feeling she was completely out of my league but what kills me inside to most is that the more I think about it, the more I think what wasted opportunity I had.

I was into her the minute I met her and even through my insecurity I managed to get her number, visited her house and she visiting mine. We would even talk about sex and fantasize about being together however we would both always chalk it up to joking around. But even through all that I let her slip through the cracks, without even a kiss. I feel I'm the direct example of the Shakespearean adage of ""Better to have loved and lost than to never love at all"", with me obviously being an example of the later.

I tried to get things to return how they were but she was just too weird and resulted in us no longer talking. We have spoken about it since but it didn't resolve anything. In hindsight I should've just given us both space rather than rushing to go back to how everything was.

If you've been in this position before, how long did it take to go back to normal, if it ever did? Is there any advice you can offer?

2926,When is it cool &amp; when is it Not okay to message a guy swimsuit pics of yourself?,"I have swimsuit pictures on the beach that are tasteful and I personally see nothing wrong with messaging the pics to guys who are messaging me on social media’s showing verbal/written interest in me, but some people online seem to think that it is “weird” and “awkward” for me to do this unless I’m already in an established dating relationship with the guy and me and the guy have dated at least 5 times or more. What do you think?

I mean plenty of girls have swimsuit pictures in their public main Instagram profiles so why is that “okay” whereas me messaging the pics to guys who show interest in me by asking me about myself through my message inbox... is somehow “not okay”?

I’m confused. If a guy is messaging me asking me about myself and keeps notifying messaging me then he is obviously interested so why can’t I randomly send him swimsuit pics?

2927,How can I enjoy going to bars alone if I don't drink?,"Long story short, I'm a gay dude and I want to go to a gay bar near my college. Problem is, I don't drink, which is what people do at bars. I want to be more social and make new friends. The last time I was at this gay bar it was only filled with a couple old guys I recognized off of Grindr and I walked out. This Friday I plan on going back and trying for a second time. 

How do you mingle in a bar by yourself if you don't drink alcohol? I've never took a sip of beer, and my parents stopped when they found out they were going to have my older brother. Drinking/bars are a huge part of gay + college life. I feel so lonely not being part of it, yet hate it at the same time. What should I do?
