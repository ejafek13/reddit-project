Men of Reddit: How can I deal with insecurities in my relationship?,"Hey guys, 

  
I'm (23F) recently becoming really insecure in my relationship. Always jumping to conclusion and thinking my boyfriend (22M) is either cheating on me or planning to. I know deep deep down that he's not and that he's genuinely not like that but I can't seem to stop my mind from jumping to conclusions and most of the time, I know I'm being crazy so I don't say anything but other times it comes out and we fight. I know that when I say the stuff that I say, it hurts him and it makes me feel so bad. I'm a jealous person and even though I don't really mind if he hangs with females friends, I still get annoyed when he mentions one of them. 

  
I really love him, we had a rocky start in our relationship... I broke his heart and left him for someone else because I thought he was immature but we reconected and he gave me another chance. I'm eternally grateful for this oportunity and everyday I try and show him that I changed and that I'm comitted 110% to him and to him only.

"Straight guys, are you fully aware of how incredibly picky women generally are when it comes to selecting male partners?","It's a typical work day and I'm on my lunch break with a couple of my female colleagues. I'm a young, funny and friendly gay guy so of course girls and I are naturally drawn to friendships with each other. I know what girls are like and what they're into and most importantly, how they operate. I've been at the canteen table many times when one of the single girls pulls out her phone and starts swiping on Tinder and showing us her ""potential matches"" she has to choose from on the app. Most days we will slip into a routine where we will pass the phone around to each other and I'm always astounded at how most of the girls will swipe left on about 70% of the guys. Swiping right on guys that are athletic, good looking with good skin and nice hair. They do so without even reading the profile. Guys that look objectively athletic, handsome and attractive. They're just swiping left on a good portion of them and when I exclaim *""Why are you not even entertaining the majority of these guys? Most of these look really decent and well put together?""* But they can't really answer my question. It does appear that girls have a far higher reach than men when it comes to what they find attractive. And I'm not even talking about AFTER they've decided to read the profile or even get the gist of a guys personality. They're often not interested in guys; even a good portion of the good looking ones. They'll even admit ""he looks quite nice"" but still, they're not stimulated.

When I get the phone I'm swiping right on most of the guys I find attractive which is a bulk of them (also I'm trying to help at least one brother out) but when the girls have the phone they are incredibly selective. I see on here a lot of guys struggling to find dates or appropriate relationships with women and I can't help noticing from the outside that the dating expectations between males and females are DRASTICALLY asymmetrical. Of course we can't pin all of men's dating failures on female pickiness. A fair portion of you are going to be guys who don't have their sh*t together and probably just aren't going to attract a suitable female. (Or you are just unattractive). And of course not ALL women are this picky. 

But I felt compelled to ask this question because it completely astounds me how guys I would be perfectly happy to go on a date with purely based on attraction and looks most girls won't even entertain a conversation with. So I was wondering if men were even aware of just how selective women truly were?

Slim, pretty and conventionally attractive girls of varying personalities, races and ages. I have been at the table with my less attractive female colleagues.

I'm a young, funny and friendly gay guy so of course girls and I are naturally drawn to friendships with each other. I know what girls are like and what they're into and most importantly, how they operate. I've been at the canteen table many times when one of the single girls pulls out her phone and starts swiping on Tinder and showing us her ""potential matches"" she has to choose from on the app. Most days we will slip into a routine where we will pass the phone around to each other and I'm always astounded at how most of the girls will swipe left on about 70% of the guys. Swiping right on guys that are athletic, good looking with good skin and nice hair. They do so without even reading the profile. Guys that look objectively athletic, handsome and attractive. They're just swiping left on a good portion of them and when I exclaim *""Why are you not even entertaining the majority of these guys? Most of these look really decent and well put together?""* But they can't really answer my question. It does appear that girls have a far higher reach than men when it comes to what they find attractive. And I'm not even talking about AFTER they've decided to read the profile or even get the gist of a guys personality. They're often not interested in guys; even a good portion of the good looking ones. They'll even admit ""he looks quite nice"" but still, they're not stimulated.

When I get the phone I'm swiping right on most of the guys I find attractive which is a bulk of them (also I'm trying to help at least one brother out) but when the girls have the phone they are incredibly selective. I see on here a lot of guys struggling to find dates or appropriate relationships with women and I can't help noticing from the outside that the dating expectations between males and females are DRASTICALLY asymmetrical. Of course we can't pin all of men's dating failures on female pickiness. A fair portion of you are going to be guys who don't have their sh*t together and probably just aren't going to attract a suitable female. (Or you are just unattractive). And of course not ALL women are this picky. 

But I felt compelled to ask this question because it completely astounds me how guys I would be perfectly happy to go on a date with purely based on attraction and looks most girls won't even entertain a conversation with. So I was wondering if men were even aware of just how selective women truly were?

Fellow Danglers have you or any other chap ever been critised for crying and what was the story and your feelings about that?,"This questions comes from something I found online.

It just got me thinking. Wow you gotta be a sick pathetic human being to make fun of a guy for crying over the death of his sister.

I myself have been criticized about twice for crying (ive cried alot but never insulted that much if at all over my lifetime)

First was when we were watching The Boy in the Striped Pajamas in highschool. I walked out because I didnt wanna see the ending and I was crying alot.

Another boy saw me and for a week he wouldn't shut up about it. Even when I went to the teachers it made it worse. Eventually well... Highschool shit happened and he went away with a busted lip and a bloody nose. Worth it only 4 days. Never bothered me again.

Ex Dumped Me: 'Not interested in a relationship'.,"Long story short: He broke up with me yesterday saying that he 'wasn't interested in a relationship' and that he wasn't as attracted to me as he thought.

He accused me of wetting the bed wtaf,"I've been secretly in love with male friend for over 20+ years but always think I hide it well. Always suspected it was mutual, but never actually acted on it as the time was never right- and now we are both married so can't. A few days ago I bumped into him and we were both alone- usually I have my guard up, but I think the surprise made me forget my usual defences and I could not take my eyes off him, so Im pretty sure my body language gave me away.

We were chatting normally enough in a local public space when all of a sudden he exclaimed ""you wet the bed!"" I of course was indignant, but someone (local!!) who overheard said they thought I did???  Obviously we were sitting down and not in bed at all, so I continued to argue with him in a light hearted manner, hoping to throw him off. 

After this he kept staring me down for what seemed like ages. Im pretty inexperienced with men but he seemed angry and like he was trying to dominate me. He is a dominant/controlling person, which is one reason why Ive kept him at arms length even though there are obviously feelings.  After a while of hard staring he relaxed and continued talking as usual- then asked for a hug when I left and was smiling in his eyes! 

I now fear I may have smelled of wee...or perhaps he meant something else?? I realise that I was horny/ ovulating \*blush\*

How do you Network and Connect with guys of High Social Status ?,"I was watching a documentary where a bunch of guys were racing their own sports cars on a track, and I found it interesting where they had a scene where they talked about themselves and what each one does for a living, but they didn’t really mention how they got to know each other.

I mean the common theme was that they were all relatively rich, and fairly young (hence fun, new money style). So it just got me thinking, How do guys really network and build connections with such types of people that are into a fun type of lifestyle?

Before anyone suggests it’s just about “having money”, that’s not entirely true because first of all the difference between some of them was quite big, like one guy was in the $10M range and another was $100M+ . Those are both insane either way I know, but it’s just to say that in the same manner one can apply the same concept on their own situation. And second of all, I was just talking to a friend of mine who knows quite a few of such people (the $10M range though, not $100M), and he was telling me how some of them are really miserable and use their money to attract the company of normal people around them. Despite being young and perfectly cool people.

So I’m just curious about that. How would a guy find a solid social circle of like-minded guys ? 

Or especially if you have the means to engage in such activities but you’re not necessarily “rich” in the $10M range.. how would you still get your foot into the door to be able to go out and have fun with such people ?",AskMen,"How do you Network and Connect with guys of High Social Status ?I was watching a documentary where a bunch of guys were racing their own sports cars on a track, and I found it interesting where they had a scene where they talked about themselves and what each one does for a living, but they didn’t really mention how they got to know each other.

What is a reasonably priced cologne that smells similar to the Kira line from Pac Sun in the early-late 2000's?,"Does anyone know of a fragrance that matches it?

For reference in case you are unfamiliar, Kira cologne was discontinued about 10 years ago. It has a lightly exotic/fruity smell with a masculine undertone.

It was one of my favorite fragrances to wear when I was in an informal setting. I have seen unused NOS bottles of Kira listed on eBay occasionally for exorbitant prices, however, the fragrance seemed to degrade in one of my bottles after very minimal usage for about 10 years, so I am not willing to risk buying an old bottle and have it end up a disgusting mess.

Fellow dudes...is that what the friendzone looks like?,"Well me and this girl have been talking for some time now and I recently told her that I don’t want to be just friends with her, I was totally honest and told her that I would like to get to know her better, with romantic intentions and plans in mind and I told her that I plan to go for her ‘officially’ i.e engagement/marriage if everything goes right, but also told her that if she just sees me as a platonic college friend then I don’t want any part of that. Her response: “my respect for you went up so much since you were clear and honest in what you wanted because when you asked me out I thought you just wanted to go out and hook up like most guys do these days, we should become friends and get to know each other’s personalities better, then if all is good we both cab take the next step”

Is that good or bad? Wouldn’t she not give me a chance if she didn’t like me on some level, unless she’s stringing me along I guess?

Bear in mind that we’re in middle east environment here so she doesn’t really go out with a guy before engagement, reserved/religious background etc etc i.e here you have to ask her parents first before engagement/marriage aka official proposals

Anybody improve themselves and not see the results they were looking for?,"So I went through a rough time after a long term relationship and it sent me into a pretty bad clinical depression especially because I realized I was not the good person I always thought I was. I attempted suicide but ended up not doing that obviously. So I decided to get help and got on anti-depressants and started therapy and bettering myself. This also led to a new found confidence in myself and a deeper love of learning.

Is he just not that into me?,"
This is kind of a long story, so sorry in advance. So one of my co-workers set me up with this guy that works in a different department. She mentioned he had a thing for me, and I saw him a couple times in passing and thought he was cute, so I took a chance and reached out to him on social media. He seemed happy I messaged him first, which was a huge relief because it's not like me at all to be the bold one in these situations. 

We texted here and there, and my friend told me he likes the girl to take control so I should ask him to hang out first rather than wait for him to ask me. So again, I took the initiative and asked him to hang out. He was down for it, and we made plans to hang out that week.  I met up with him at a restaurant and we had good conversation and I felt like things went pretty well. He even kept saying things that hinted he wanted to hang out again, without actually saying it. He's the type that's constantly joking around and never really serious though, so it's hard to tell what he's thinking most of the time. 

So he drove me back to my car and immediately leaned in to kiss me. This wasn't just a peck, he dove right in and things escalated quickly. He asked me to go back to his place, but I told him didn't have time because I had to be home soon. We ended up hooking up right in his car. It all happened so fast, and to be honest I would've preferred to wait, but it just kind of happened and I didn't stop it. 

It's been about 4 days and we've talked twice since our date, but both times I've had to initiate the conversation. Maybe I'm being too overbearing, but I'm not used to always having to text first, and then getting little response in return. He'll text back maybe a couple times and then stop responding. I asked if we were hanging out again and he said yes, but then made a dumb joke after and never set up a day with me for a second date or anything. He likes all my posts on social media but barely texts me back for very long and like I said,  I always have to text first.

Am I just wasting my time or being overly paranoid and clingy? Was this most likely just a hook-up to him? I'm not sure what to make of this whole thing because all the guys I've been with in the past have been the complete opposite.",AskMen,"Is he just not that into me?

How do you guys deal with being ghosted?,"I can’t understand how this is so popular these days. I’ve literally been ghosted by 20 women in a row. It always goes the same way, meet at a bar/somewhere and exchange information (usually Facebook), start chatting, and out of nowhere the messages stay unread and there is no response. 

Let’s look at 2 cases that just happened today:

Know a girl through a friend and I have her number and she messages me for a doobie. I run it out to her and we sit in her car chatting for a while. I send her a message saying maybe we can chat somewhere other than her car. One message, no pressure and no follow up. 2 weeks later she messages me back saying how sorry she was for not responding and that yeah she’s definitely down to chill some time. I say that sounds great, it’s nice out next week how about then some time? No response. Follow up a couple days later with a suggestion, nothing. What gives? She could have just left it at the first message but she messages me back just to ignore me. 

Second girl I met through a job and we chat for a few days online. She is super friendly likes my jokes and the mid conversation she stops reading my messages and never replies again. I didn’t ask her out or anything and she just stops responding in the middle of the convo. I then asked her a couple days later if she likes tacos. No response or anything. 

I’ve noticed no girl ever says no. I ask them if they’re down to get together, they always say yeah sure just later and then when I try to schedule a time it always goes to ghost. 

What is the deal with that? I’m just venting right now but I cannot believe people think it’s acceptable to just stop communicating mid convo. If they just send “not interested” or “no thanks” I wouldn’t ask them again but they always say sure, just not this week. So then I have to ask again and it’s always “sure, later” until it’s a ghost job. Is saying no really that hard?

The worst part is I’m a great conversationalist, very successful, work with music and music festivals, have travelled the world and just want someone to talk to *in person*.  I would always rather talk in person than online, but I cannot get past the text phase. I haven’t been on an actual date in what seems like forever.

"HOW CAN I HELP HIM REALIZE THAT GOING TO THERAPY DOESN'T MEAN HE'S ""WEAK?""","My hubby has a systemic family anger problem---him, his brothers, his dad, his grandfather, so on and so forth and ALL of the men in the family suffer in their relationships because of it. Ironically (and sadly) the only one of the 9 kids in the dad's family who didn't have a severe anger problem, lost his wife to lung cancer---so there's a nice ""here's what happens when you aren't mad at the world"" lesson for the rest of the family.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we're dealing with a jealousy issue that I am getting some assistance for from my own therapist---hubby and I did couples together years ago but recently he's back at the ""there's nothing wrong with me, why would i go?"" stage.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to explain that his anger (specifically toward stronger/more opinionated women) is a learned behavior---literally ALL of the men in his family are like this---and that he can learn a new behavior if that's what he wants--of course he then reminds me that his Dad says ""Shrinks are for f\*gs""-- He says it was ""different"" when we were going as a couple because it wasn't just about him. Here's my subquestions to the question in the title:

1-If his dad and/or brother(s) went to therapy too--either with him in a group or seperately + individually (depending on recommendation of therapist)--what's the hive think are the chances of him opening up to it? 

2-I've explained and so have some other friends and family that therapy isn't really as torturous as so many people make it out to be--you just talk about yourself for an hour! What other points can I make that might help him realize that therapy is actually supposed to be helpful?

3-Help me understand why this is still such a thing! This is an all Irish family and they'd all rather drink and fight than talk about their feelings--with each other or anybody else---when the oldest brother died suddenly a few years ago they ALL (literally all of them) said ""I never got the chance to tell Billy that I loved him..."" and despite this lesson on our limited time in this life, these men are still paralyzed by fear when it comes to potentially emotional situations. How do I tell a manly man that the bravest and toughest thing he can do is be open about his feelings?

How do I get over my feelings for a co-worker?,"So, about four months ago this girl started at the company I work for.

I thought she was attractive from day one, but being able to say the same for several of my female colleagues, it wasn't a major issue. I soon found out she was in a long-term relationship, so again it didn't really worry me too much.

This has all changed in the last few weeks, since we've been assigned to work on a couple of projects together. The more time I spend with her, the more my feelings for her have grown. While most of our conversations are professional and work-based, we get on extremely well and there have been odd moments where we've been flirty with each other, although nothing inappropriate.

Now rational me says she has a boyfriend and telling her how I feel is only going to end in tears and probably affect my job, but I can't shake off how I feel and really want to know if she feels the same way.

I think the problem is that outside of work, I never have an issue asking girls out. Even if I get a flat no, I much prefer that to keeping quiet, and if it's a no I get over it pretty quickly and move on. I've never had this happen at work before, but it's obviously a lot different to chatting to someone in a bar. I also feel like a dick because she has a boyfriend and I know how I'd feel if someone was seriously hitting on my girlfriend, but as much as I try to ignore it, I can't change the way I feel. 

So I guess the question is what should I do? How do I stop this from eating away at me? Is it even worth the risk of saying something?

How can I start feeling okay about not feeling okay?,"I wrote up this comment for a recent askreddit thread but was a bit late to the party. 

I don't tell my girlfriend when I'm sad. Which is pretty often because we're long distance right now.

How can I be less stressful to my fiance,"So, my fiance and I have been a little rocky for a while. He says he doesnt like to be around me anymore because he finds me very stressful. I have adhd and I've been trying to do better with house keeping and other things, but I'm a very emotional person because of my condition, so I tend to feel things more strongly than others.

Last week he was very loving and we were very happy. This week hes back to being grumpy and withdrawn. Yesterday we had a fight and he wanted to end our relationship. We are still together, but he said that I'm trying too hard to make things better and that im genuinely just a huge source of stress in his life.

He doesnt know exactly what I do that causes him stress, and he has a lot of other sources of stress in his life that make the situation worse. I know men deal with stress different than women. I want to talk things out but the more I try the more distant he becomes.

So, what I'm trying to figure out is what I can do to make things better. I want to be a source of love and support, not frustration and stress. Men who have been in this situation and gotten passed it, what are the actions that I can take to strengthen our relationship?

 We've been together for 8 years and are both really young (mid-life 20s). He has a huge financial burden on his shoulders, as well as school. I'm trying to do overtime at work to help us financially and am working to keep the house clean (clutter also stresses him). He tends to work very late most nights so he comes home already stressed and tired most weekdays.

What can I do to take some stress off of him, or what behaviors tend to hurt a relationship from a mans perspective?

He doesnt know exactly what I do that causes him stress, and he has a lot of other sources of stress in his life that make the situation worse. I know men deal with stress different than women. I want to talk things out but the more I try the more distant he becomes.

So, what I'm trying to figure out is what I can do to make things better. I want to be a source of love and support, not frustration and stress. Men who have been in this situation and gotten passed it, what are the actions that I can take to strengthen our relationship?

 We've been together for 8 years and are both really young (mid-life 20s). He has a huge financial burden on his shoulders, as well as school. I'm trying to do overtime at work to help us financially and am working to keep the house clean (clutter also stresses him). He tends to work very late most nights so he comes home already stressed and tired most weekdays.

What can I do to take some stress off of him, or what behaviors tend to hurt a relationship from a mans perspective? What could I be doing wrong that, as a woman, I feel will make things better but tends to have the opposite effect?"

How do i make sure i'm not neglecting my boyfriend?,"Since i started classes full time in addition to work I feel that I haven't been as available as I usually am in terms of physical affection and emotional needs.

I am high functioning - on the spectrum, and I already have a hard time noticing when I'm not being as emotionally attentive as I should. My bf understands and says its understandable that I'm busy, but i know he's just being polite. Our communication is great, so i know my empathy has improved (his own words).

I just want advice on things to do without it always having to be a discussion. I want it to seem that I'm not clueless for once, and that i don't need to be prompted or have him explicitly ask for things a normal person would probably think of on their own.

What do you do if your girl is being harassed at work?,"My girl kept complaining to me like once a week that this guy from work kept making insensitive remarks like “hey sexy”, “you’re so sexy today” every time he sees her.

How to recover from a long relationship,"For context, in November I, regretfully, broke up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years. I wasn’t myself for the last 4ish months of the relationship because of a lot of stress in life, and one day I popped and broke up with her.

Why do men get married?,"Hey guys! I’m recently engaged, and very happy. I (28f) am totally in love with my fiancé (39m). He’s a wonderful man, and we’ve been through some intense highs and lows in the three years we’ve been together. We decided to stick together and make it permanent.

I’ve been wondering a lot though... I’ve seen very few relationships stand the test of time. My parents split, my grandparents split, every aunt and uncle, most close friends I’ve had... it seems like everyone eventually gets divorced. 

It’s very discouraging to see people make the leap, trusting each other with their hearts, bodies, homes, family and finances, then fall apart.

Marriage seems like a particularly bad deal for men. Not that I’m the type to chase him down for half his stuff if it doesn’t work, but a lot of women do. And don’t get me started about the legal issues that get kids taken from their fathers. It’s heartbreaking.

How would you feel about dating a woman who works part time because of mental health issues?,"28F with diagnosed bipolar and anxiety disorders here (the bipolar is mostly under control with meds and therapy, so it’s mainly the anxiety that’s the issue).

I was thinking of asking her to do something tomorrow (Thursday) since I'll be away Friday-sunday. Is this too soon? Should I wait until next week? When should I text her? How do you guys usually approach early dates?"
How do you act differently around a female friend to make it clear you’re just interested in being friends?,"We’ve seen the countless posts wondering ‘is he flirting?’ ‘how do I know if he’s flirting or being friendly?’ etc. But those questions and answers are usually framed in terms of what hints to look for that indicate flirting.

What I’m wondering is the flip side: guys, when you know or suspect that a female friend is into you, but you’re NOT interested like that, what do you do or say to communicate that? Do you act any differently?

Let’s assume the guy in question is interested in women and not in a relationship, because “I’m gay” or “I have a girlfriend/partner/SO” seem like obvious solutions to this problem, but they may not always apply.

I ask because as a woman, I recognize a lot of the different ways women hint or signal to men ‘just friends’ or ‘not interested,’ but I don’t know what it looks like for guys in that situation.

Edit: Please no joke answers about how this never happens because all straight men are always horny for all women. Maybe you are, but if that’s the case then this isn’t the question for you.

How can I get along with my bf's friends despite our age gap (10yr)?,"I (F 20) have just met my bf (M 30)'s friends and I don't know if they can accept me, due to our age gap. I really like my bf, I'm aware of how complicated a relationship with such an age gap could be and I know it has more chances of not lasting long, but I just want to enjoy things till they work. 
I know his friends and I are in different phases of life and that we don't have a ton of thing in common (e.g. they work while I study, they live on their own while I'm still at my parents house...), so it could be more difficult to become part of the group. However I want to be part of my bf's world and he wants it too, so I think it's very important to find a way to get along with his fellows and their gfs. 
When I met them I felt that on the one hand they kinda disapproved our relationship (I can understand it, I know age gap relationship have to face social disapproval), but on the other they pointed out pretty often how happier my bf seemed since we started dating.
I don't know how to behave

How do guys feel when a girl makes the first move?,"A little backstory:

I'm (17F) currently dating a guy (18M) who has liked me for almost 3 years. We were classmates in 9th grade but I went to a different university after that so we haven't seen each other for more than a year and a half. 

I used to date girls before and it's my first time dating a guy. I asked him out after the new years eve and he was very excited about it. 

So basically, I was his first date and I also initiated his first kiss. I looove hugs so I hug him all the time and I like to wrap my arms around him from behind and do the awkward waddle paddle walk. I did all of the first move since he was too shy and had no dating experience.

Men- why does my boyfriend make sexist jokes?,"I think he thinks they're harmless and funny. I don't get it. As far as sexist jokes go, they're pretty mild.

Is there is a reason for this type of humor? I don't understand.

I'm not angry, per se. It just rubs me the wrong way. Should I say something? If so, what justification do I have, because they're not really bad? Or am I being oversensitive here? Because aside from this, he basically treats me like a queen. Is it worth nit picking this?

Already went from no muscle to somewhat toned and bigger. I have also completely cut junk food (which I ate much of daily) and soda. Have started eating LOTS of protein and healthy snacking between meals. Also eating more in general, but healthy. Drinking more water.

Anyways, I measured myself out to be around 13% bodyfat. Idk how accurate this is.

I understand I’ve just started working abs but they barely show up. Idk if it’s due to fat or lack of muscle from never working out.

How do you handle your girl's cooking being bad?,"I fucked up. She cooked for me and I knew exactly what this was gonna taste like before we even finished buying the ingredients.

For context she's a 22yo grad student and college kids aren't exactly known for their culinary expertise.

Sorry if that sounds really harsh but I can't tell her that. Might immediate reaction (after prepping myself by taste testing when she wasn't in the room) was to say I need to teach her how to make sauce.

In my defense this food is inedible. I just don't know how to console her or respond to the ""everyone else likes it"" when there's no way that could be true.

casual dating or strictly a booty call?,"i figured it would be best to get a guy's perspective on this. 

so i (27F) have been casually seeing this one guy 29M for the past few weeks. first date went well and we set up a second, which went well too and ended with us sleeping together, and led to a third date that ended the same way right before the holiday season. 

holidays came and went and we've only been able to see each-other once since then and he literally just invited me over to his apartment to have sex. 🤷

no shame in that but in-between then there's been some sexting and a little bit of texting but tbh we've never texted much, only to make plans to hangout. 

what throws me off is that this guy got out of an 8+ yr relationship like 7 months before we met and i'm the first person he's been with apparently. 

so my question is — does this come off as some kind of casual thing or more of a rebound booty call thing?

What’s something you’ve seen a guy get shamed for enjoying because someone else was too preoccupied with his “masculinity”?,"Was just curious about possible encounters you’ve witnessed of another man being shamed for liking something by another man or woman because it’s not a “masculine” thing to *them.* Or maybe you’ve experienced it yourself.

I’ve always been an advocate of sticking up for men who get shamed for things like this- because people should just be able to enjoy things *that don’t even cause others harm* without being mocked for it.

For example, the other day at work, me and my male coworker were talking about weekend plans, and he said he and his girlfriend were going to get pedicures together. And I was like ‘oh that’s nice.’ And then another male coworker of ours, whose usually an okay dude, starts joking him about it and I’m just like dude fuck off?

"Girlfriend Abusive, testing me? What am I dealing with?","TL;DR

1 year+ into the relationship and first like for ""real"" relationship but i know in reality it isn't because of our age.
I am 20, she's 18.

Me and my girlfriend that are in long distance used to talk and call every day. 
Maybe lately I was too available for her and It probably annoyed her. She made me also lose trust, and made me like controlling and suspect her I admit it's not good any tips for that? Let me know please. 

It let to her respond slower at first, and not answer calls directly.

So I talked about it and she now suddenly tells me calling every day is not right and that she didn't want to see me every day and also she was bored and easily irritated. I told her you need space? She tells me no, I'm not taking space from relationship and tells me ""I always love you"" but i know she is also influenced by her sisters and talking about me behind my back.

She became emotionally distant.

Is she testing me to see if i can live without her?

""Remember before it all happened it came in stages and this is the aftermath""

Day 1: Almost no response 3 times maybe. And a 1 missed call of her just because i wanted but she didn't look interested. I called her later  instead and a pop up came she was in another call and she still didn't respond to my text. So I called her out, called her ""devil"" for treating me like this and then ""she"" wanted to throw a tantrum for me saying that it took her very long to reply. The next day she says I wasn't on a ""call"" later she admits she called and tells me it's not a boy or something like that but ""someone important"" childish right?. I think either she was testing me or something really happened.
On this day It took her hours to reply at certain times. Sometimes 5 or 6!!! But I didn't feel any remorse because basically it made me think she is not worth it and i accepted mentally that she isn't my girlfriend anymore. And shockingly when watching a random youtube video, and saw a girl talking and my brain said this: that's what my ""ex would think"" i said it unconsciously to myself.

So i told her why are you still behaving like that? She told me I'm not gonna break up with you and I am not seeing someone else. ""But i don't believe it"" I don't really care that much anymore, because she pushes me away. And to be honest i am more hurt for getting treated this way.

Day 2: I wasn't gonna initiate any texts anymore. We didn't even talk or something but she kept me up to date sometimes on what she was doing and more then the first day. And tells me at the end of the day, sorry that I didn't have much time for you,""I love you always"". (I got really pissed because it isn't true) but I held it in me, and told her kindly just goodnight."" She tells me I call you tomorrow. But i am not excited at all to see her and feel like ignoring or maybe worse breaking up. I know that even if she will call me, she would still be slow responsive and not call me everyday and treat me like dirt.

Conclusion:

1. She says im not taking space but she isn't putting any effort into relationship, But she tells me she isn't. Is my girlfriend trying to convince me her behaviour is normal? We used to call every day and text eachother because we are in long distance.

2. Any hope left of her behaving like she used to be? Is this a phase?

I didn't have problems with us seeing often because of the distance. But it isn't right. I cannot see the person ""i love"" but she clearly is not the same anymore.  She just told me i love you and i always do. But words is nothing, it's just words it doesn't make me feel in love or give me hope. Because of the way i get treated i find it manipulative and abusive is she abusing me?

I know it's not true what she says and how she behaves. It's like she is changing the rules for her own favour and I feel tested.

Any advice?

"What's your take on this list titled ""Men, you want to treat women better? Here's a list to start with.""?","Talk to your friend who is “kind of a creep” at work.

Don’t talk over women.

If you are asked to be on a panel/team and see that it’s all men, say something. Maybe even refuse the spot!

When you see another guy talk over a woman, say: “Hey, she was saying something.”

Learn to read a fucking room.

Don’t call women “crazy” in a professional setting.

Don’t use your “feminism” as a way to get women to trust you. Show us in your day-to-day life, not in your self-congratulatory social media.

Don’t touch women you don’t know, and honestly, ask yourself why you feel the need to touch women in general.

Do you feel that any woman on earth owes you something? She doesn’t. Even if you’re like, “Hm, but what about basic respect?” ask yourself if you’ve shown her the same.

Don’t send pictures of your penis unless she just asked for them.

If a woman says no to a date, don’t ask her again.

If a woman has not given an enthusiastic “yes” to sex, back the hell off.

If a woman is really drunk, she cannot consent to you and she also cannot consent to your buddy who seems to be trying something. Your buddy is your responsibility, so say something and intervene.

If you do the right thing, don’t expect praise or payment or a pat on the back or even a “thank you from that woman”. Congratulations, you were baseline decent.

Involve women in your creative projects, then let them have equal part in them.

Don’t make misogynistic jokes.

Don’t expect women to be “nice” or “cute” and don’t get upset when they aren’t those things.

Don’t make assumptions about a woman’s intelligence, capabilities or desires based on how she dresses.

Pay women as much as you pay men.

If a woman tells you that you fucked up, and you feel like shit, don’t put it on that woman to make you feel better. Apologize without qualification and then go away.

Don’t punish women for witnessing your vulnerability.

Don’t get defensive when you get called out.

Don’t need to literally witness a man being horrible in order to believe that he’s horrible. Trust and believe women.

Don’t use your power to get women’s attention/company/sex/etc.

Be aware of your inherent power in situations and use it to protect women, especially via talking to other men.

Stop thinking that because you’re also marginalized or a survivor that you cannot inflict pain or oppress women.

How do I ask the guy I'm seeing to be more kinky in bed? And how can I address that he doesn't stop even when he cum?,"Hi all! 

I (23F)  am going out with this guy (26M) for around 3 weeks now. We've met around 5/6 times already and had sex on the second date.
He's pretty nice, handsome, sweet etc. We get along and being spending some pretty nice time together. 

I need advice with: 
1 - everytime we had sex I would not know when he cums. Like he don't say anything and also I really can't tell lol so happened some times that I am there on top (which is super often bc I really like it) and then I asked if he cum already and he says yeah? But then means we were having sex with the condom filled which is not safe and weird lol any advice of how to talk to him and any ideas of why he doesn't say anything?? 

2 - I really like some more kinky stuff like choking, slapping, hair pulling, etc etc, but he seems to be pretty vanilla on bed. The sex is good but I really miss something more rough. Would you recommend me asking him during sex (like ""pull my hair"" or ""choke me"") or maybe addressing it another moment?

What is the best way to deal with bedhead?,"I generally shower during the afternoon/evening and then get into bed. When I wake up my hair (indian, lots of volume) tends to get plastered up in various directions. It isnt greasy or anything, but no amount of plain water fixes it. In order to get it to lay back in its usual hairstyle, i have to full on wash my head with soap and hot water, dry off, and then comb it.

is there a faster/easier way to fix it? Its not really a huge deal for most mornings, I just bend over the tub or sink, or worst case scenario i'll just hop in and take a full on second shower. But it does become a problem during the warmer months when im also attempting to fix helmet hair. Or when i get that dent in it from wearing headphones all day.

My wife just brushes her hair out, for me no amount of combing, wet or dry, will fix it.

I figured maybe some of you guys would know what a better method to fix it is so im not soaping my hair multiple times a day.",AskMen,"What is the best way to deal with bedhead?I generally shower during the afternoon/evening and then get into bed.

As a shout out to all our moms out there how did you traumatize your mom when you hit puberty as a teen?,"I love my mom and part of that is for how she took the teenage bullshit I put her through like a champ.

Have any of you ever had a vitamin supplement cause a bad smell?,"I'm a clean person, my job isn't physically demanding (I work in the ER), and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week. (Relevant later) However, over the last few months I have noticed a smell around the glans of my penis that I've never had before (I'm circumcised). I thought it was from sweating at the gym, but I happened to notice it when I was about to get off work a few times before I even worked out. I wear scrubs so nothing is causing me to sweat. I started taking some supplements like Omega 3, Turmeric with curcumin, vitamin D3 with coconut oil (I take this every winter for seasonal affected depression, it helps) and some Glucosamine Chondrointin pills a few months back. I thought maybe it was the Omega 3 so I stopped taking them last week. The problem persists.

Are men willing to commit to a serious relationship while being a student in university?,"Me, female / mid 20s. 

I'm trying to figure out if it's something that's possible or if people are generally closed off to the idea. I yearn for a sincere relationship where you grow with your partner. I want to have a good time, learn together, build each other up, explore, laugh, cuddle, resolve differences with quality communication, bond intimately, etc. I dont want it to be superficial and temporary, I want to make an investment. I'm tired of witnessing the general population (in my age group) lack desire to be monogamous and committed. I mean, to each their own, I dont judge. It's just extremely hard finding someone who shares my desires of the real thing. Seems like most people just want to focus on themselves and not go out of their way to make things work. I'm aware I'm generalizing, this is just my anecdotal experience. 

Speaking for yourself, would you be willing to commit to someone and make it work even if it's logistically difficult? 

E.g. I'm from LA and will be in SD for 2 years and unsure where I'll end up after. If I'm in a genuine relationship, I would be willing to make it work and compromise where my partner and I lived. Is that not the common consensus? Do people just want to study with their heads down and/or have casual flings and date when they're more settled? If you find something worth fighting for, would you choose not to?

I maintain excellent grades and am able to commit without dragging anyone down, including myself. Do people fear a relationship would jeopardize their education?",AskMen,"Are men willing to commit to a serious relationship while being a student in university?Me, female / mid 20s.

How do I deal with my first big heartbreak?,"I've been talking to this girl for about 4 months, we pretty much clicked instantly and got to know each other really well and honestly I think I fell in love. On New Years I asked her out and she said yes, we continued to date and it was kind of long distance (she lived about 2 hours away from I did, but that didn't stop me from seeing her as much as possible) which made things a little difficult at times. I even changed my mind about which university I wanted to go to just so that I could be closer to her. Unfortunately she's recently had a hard time adjusting to her life as we've both just finished High School and are getting ready to pursue a career or continue studying at a university. 
This hardship has pushed her to the point of breaking up with me, despite all that I've said to ease her and attempt to look for a different solution she's decided it's best that she stays single for now. I understand it may be what she needs and I don't wish her any hardship because I can see the problem from her side of the coin as well as my own. What I don't understand is why I feel so bad, like I've been pushed around and fucked over. I really liked this girl, and it wasn't like any of my previous relationships, this girl was special. Unfortunately she's a bit stubborn like me so she won't be getting back together with me until she stitches her life back together.
She's stated that I haven't lost her and that she wishes to try again when all is well. As much as I like her I'm not too sure about this idea, I feel like if we got back together in say 6 months it would be awkward and it wouldn't work as well as it has this first time.

Men of reddit, what do I do? I'm now stuck in a university I only chose because of her, I can't stop thinking about her and breaking down and I'm not sure about getting back together after a break, despite my feelings for her.

I agreed with some comments like when some dude say I have big dick or how many woman he gets. But what pisses me off is they categorized as lies the advice that some people gave to them. Like realtionship advice and advice on life, they just shit on that. Like saying ""relationship is like a straight line, but it's damn hard"", or saying ""those dudes who give advice like they have it figured it out"".

That kinda stuff is grinding my gears, some people want to give a helping hand, tried their best to help other but some are just whiny little shit who just keep complaining.

How to deal with my best friend moving away,"My best friend is leaving soon to go to Mexico for a study abroad trip, and I just said goodbye to him tonight until the next time I see him in June. I haven’t been handling it very well. He’s my smoking buddy, movie-watching buddy, 3AM trip to the grocery store buddy, and I’m gonna lose all of that for 5 months. I have other good friends here at college, so it’s not like I’ll be entirely alone, but I worry that not having him around is something I won’t be able to get over. Luckily, the silver lining in all of this is that him leaving will make me focus really hard on school, which is important for me with it being my first semester of nursing school. I’ll smoke way less, probably eat healthier, and hopefully focus more on school. I know that it’s for the best because it’s important to him. He feels like living in the US sucks (and frankly it kinda does) and he thinks his life is just gonna be fucking incredible when he lives there.

I haven’t been handling it very well. He’s my smoking buddy, movie-watching buddy, 3AM trip to the grocery store buddy, and I’m gonna lose all of that for 5 months. I have other good friends here at college, so it’s not like I’ll be entirely alone, but I worry that not having him around is something I won’t be able to get over. Luckily, the silver lining in all of this is that him leaving will make me focus really hard on school, which is important for me with it being my first semester of nursing school. I’ll smoke way less, probably eat healthier, and hopefully focus more on school. I know that it’s for the best because it’s important to him. He feels like living in the US sucks (and frankly it kinda does) and he thinks his life is just gonna be fucking incredible when he lives there.

Why are some ladies more friendly when texting or on social media and act totally different when in person?,"I have been talking to a girl who I met through a mutual friend. She is really sweet and a bit flirtatious over text, yet whenever I see her in person she acts much more reserved and cold.

How do I stop guys from harassing me.,"Hi,

I'm a 19 year old girl and I'm south-east asian. I dress modestly and am quiet religious. I try to limit my interactions with guys and lead a righteous lifestyle.

However, I can't help how I look or how my body looks. I have tan skin, black hair, and a pretty curvy figure. This has made guys refer to me as Mia Khalifa since 9th grade. As someone who is devoted to being modest, this reality made me really depressed in the past

I even changed schools, attending three different high schools but this harassment and nickname continued to follow me. I now attend college and still get harassed. I always attract the wrong attention and the wrong guys no matter how modestly I dress.

I tried cutting my hair and getting contact lenses to change my look but it has done nothing. Girls sometimes spread rumors about me just because of my shape also. 

I get cat called and have been in rather dangerous situations with guys following me home or crowding me. How can I get guys to stop harassing me? Why am I always such an easy target?

I’ve been blocked by my ex-girlfriend for about a week now. Should I stop wasting my time? She may be manipulative.,"I (24M) met her (23) during college (through Tinder). She started her graduate studies in Neuroscience for a PhD, and I was finishing up my undergraduate studies for computer science (just graduated). The first time I met her, we were getting to know each other and it was a blast: we had so much in common, she was intelligent, funny, and beautiful. About a week in, we started hooking up. And a week later, she asked me if I am her boyfriend, and I said yes. But there were multiple major red flags diving deep into the relationship.


Red flags: she told me that she had been contacting her long term ex-boyfriend as a friend and seemingly hasn’t moved on from him (he’s about 300 miles away from our college town), she always hides her phone screen from me whenever I’m near her presence, and one of my friends found her Tinder profile still up 7 weeks into dating her..

So by the time it was almost finals and the semester was about to end, the day before her birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to tag her in a “In a Relationship” status just to surprise her. I mean, 8 weeks into dating and we were working on something together, so I felt it was the right time. This backfired, and she told me that she likes to keep her private life “private”. She then had to explain to her friends, family, Mom, and ex about me. I apologized and tried to explain that it was a mistake, but she replied by blocking me on Facebook (probably to hide any ties with her)

I thought this was odd. A week after this conundrum, we spent some time together in her apartment, and while we were getting ready for bed, she asked me to give her her phone downstairs. I thought to myself that this was the moment I get to know the truth. I started snooping (unacceptable, but necessary) her messages and I found a text message from a guy who asked if she’s down for dinner while we were dating. She didn’t respond to him (or she probably deleted her responses), but I confronted her about it. She then said to me “if you think I’m cheating on you, you should leave”. She then broke down, and I said it’s okay, trying to calm her down since she was having panic attacks

The next early morning while she was sleeping, things didn’t add up to me, so I managed to snoop her phone again. This time, I found out she’s been in contact with multiple guys in the area through text (comprising of when she’s available in the evenings) and her matching on Tinder (no flirtatious messages). But the worst of it all, her text message to her ex boyfriend made my heart palpitate. She explained to him that the “In a Relationship” status was fake, claiming that I “was a graduate student who wanted her attention and stalk her or something”. Then her ex suggested to talk shit about me if she had any mutual friends

I confronted her about it, she threatened to call the police on me but she cried and tried to explain her innocence , and I naively forgave her.

So the next day, I sent her an essay of wanting to break up with her going along the lines of “I’m breaking up with you. You’re cheating on me, and I want my things back”
She said in reply “Thank you for all the bullshit assumptions and for saying I love you about an hour ago, was that just to play with my emotions? Nice to know literally everything wanting to be with me meant nothing. Goodbye, OP”
She then explained to me that she uses Tinder because she’s conceited and prideful, that she uses for attention.
I then, out of misery, said that I still love her. And she replied back with “And I still love you”

We then agreed to keep each other as “friends for now” the following day because we obviously have strong feelings for each other. 

So after graduation and during Christmas break, I burned a lot of bridges and crossed boundaries from our “break”. I sent her an essay demanding for reciprocal love during her time in work, instead of calling her I showed up unexpectedly to her apartment to ask if she’s moving on (and to get my things back), and my phone call conversations always consisted of me asking her if she still loves me and everything. Then I accused her that “I know you’ve moved on” after I found her Tinder profile 8 days ago. She said in reply that my accusations are narrative, that I am putting her on edge all of the time, and that she dearly loved me. And this caused her to block me partially everywhere. After realizing I’ve been blocked on my phone, I frantically started freaking out and was delirious. I managed to contact her via email, asking for a way to elaborate and clarify that I still trust her. She then sent me the following email:  

“I’m sorry, I literally don’t know what else to do. I’m just sitting here crying and I can’t keep doing this. I feel like you keep me on edge all of the time because I never know what you might do or say. You take narratives and run with them. I start my classes tomorrow morning and I don’t think it would be helpful if we talked right now, but I also don’t think it would be helpful in general if we were talking at all for the time being. Please understand. I’m so sorry, I don’t know how to handle this. I think you are an awesome, amazing person and I would like to talk again, but stuff like this keeps happening and it’s not okay. This hurts me so much, and I know it must hurt you too, but I think it's for the best. You will always be in my heart. Please take care of yourself and be safe. Don't isolate yourself. Talk with your friends and relatives. I'm going to get better too and everything will be okay. Maybe in the future we can talk again, I don't know, but I do know that I need to be okay first.”

I then replied her that I’ll respect her well-being, that I agree that this is probably the best for both of us, and that I dearly loved her and I’m sorry that I’ve been a shitty guy. 

Shen then told me “I appreciate that. Also, I don’t think you’re a shitty guy so please don’t beat yourself up over anything. Thank you for understanding.”

What is up with my boyfriend?,"Men are so confusing. I'm (21f) in a long distance relationship of two years with my boyfriend (22), lately he has been odd, not distance but not super lovey dovey which is fine. But after nagging him to look at his syllabus which he just got about six days ago to see when he can come see me he finally did. He was suppose to come see me this coming month but claims he is too busy and it will have to be March. I just suggest that I can come see him then. He then said he didn't want to do that because he would have almost no time to spend with me and if we are going to spend all that money and time and effort then he wants it to be when he can actually spend time with me. I don't care, just seeing him and being next to him is good enough for me, at least at night I'll be able to hold him and be close to him. I understand this is a busy semester for him, but he can almost never answer my calls and I'm always waiting for him to call. Again I'm fine with that but what makes me upset is that he doesn't say anything that sweet or sincere or does anything to make me feel loved. I try to communicate how I feel and ask him to just be affectionate and he says okay but nothing really changes. He almost seems like he isn't as in love with me as he use to.  I understand he is busy but something feels off. I know he doesn't want to break up, I actually almost broke up with him because it was so bad I didn't think he was as interested as he use to be. I use to get ""you're so pretty"" or ""you make me happy' or just sweet little things that like that even when he is busy  But now nothing.

How to deal with someone that is super cocky and always talking shit?,"so i workout with a group of people. this one dude is 6’2, 320lbs. to be brutally honest, he is fat and out of shape. yet he swears to god he is “super swole”, the “strongest in the gym”, he’s a “absolute unit” (he says all that stuff). the dude is delusional and for some reason actually believes that he is “swole”, “ripped”, and “one of the strongest in the gym”. im 5’8, 160lbs, around 12% body fat. him and i almost lift the same weight.

i got on the scale and it was 161lbs, and he goes “dude you are so small. how are you only 160”. one of the other guys backed me up and said that was a good weight for me and saying that i’m putting on size. then the other guy was like “yeah but he’s not swole like me”. i’m tired of this clown talking shit so i said “sorry i’m not fat like you. you need to loose a lot of weight then you can come talk to me”. then he got all pissed. then one of the guys was talking about what they were having for dinner and this dude goes “yeah you need to get out of here and go eat too with your small ass”. so i told him he needs to go home and skip a few meals for a weak and maybe he will loose some weight.

i got on the scale and it was 161lbs, and he goes “dude you are so small. how are you only 160”. one of the other guys backed me up and said that was a good weight for me and saying that i’m putting on size. then the other guy was like “yeah but he’s not swole like me”. i’m tired of this clown talking shit so i said “sorry i’m not fat like you. you need to loose a lot of weight then you can come talk to me”. then he got all pissed. then one of the guys was talking about what they were having for dinner and this dude goes “yeah you need to get out of here and go eat too with your small ass”. so i told him he needs to go home and skip a few meals for a weak and maybe he will loose some weight. Then he got all mad again and tried getting in my face. this dude has been talking shit for months but when i finally stand up for myself he can’t handle it and gets butthurt."

No issues, no signs, no lack of intimacy, nothing. he woke up after an amazing night out, and said he wants to be alone. He said he envisions his life alone.

How should you help your best friend with heartbreak,"For context, one of my best friends is a poor starving artist who's trying to make it in life. We decided that we would open up a company together. He has pretty low self-esteem as his family has never treated him right and always treated him like a failure for being a poor starving artist. He never really had the greatest grades in school and has been pretty down on his luck his whole life and it doesn't help that we've known each other for most of our lives and I've always been relatively successful in most of my endeavors like school and stuff and so he has always had his family compare him to me (which was not my intention at all. I just have a strict family, so I had to do well), but he's a genuinely nice guy and has helped me out many times.

So my best friend fell in love with a girl, but the girl decided to end their relationship after kinda playing around with his heart. He's been pretty devastated and has been down on his luck this whole time. He talked to me about his self-worth and how he felt himself growing older and not having much success in life and how he has always felt like a failure and how the girl playing with him made him feel worthless as though there was nothing good nor talented about him. It's an odd thing; even if he's my best friend and not family, his pain felt as if it were my pain, almost as though the girl had played with me instead of him. I didn't know exactly how to help with it, so I told him what I personally thought about relationships myself. I personally believe that relationships are there to test compatibility and that it's better to test them sooner rather than later, however I felt that it was a crummy - perhaps too logical answer, and don't believe I helped cheer him up. So I I said that I would be there for him and that if he needed me I would talk. I'm not sure what else I can do about it but it's painful seeing him so down when I know he's got immense talent within himself even if no one else thinks he does.",AskMen,"How should you help your best friend with heartbreakFor context, one of my best friends is a poor starving artist who's trying to make it in life.

Bf broke up but wants to be friends?,"
When we broke up he said he didn’t want to end on a bad note and that he still wants me in his life, just as a friend. He briefly offered we could just take a break but I was just like if you want to break up than we’ll break up and he didn’t press it further
He said the reason he wanted to break up was I flirted with a guy several months ago and while he’s been trying to trust me it’s been really hard (especially since I’m in the military so I’m away from him surrounded by a bunch of guys several days a month)

At the time, I was annoyed cause I’m pregnant and I was hoping to catch some sleep. We ended up talking the whole flight (5 hours). I kept the conversation going because I hate awkward silence. Anyway, people around us would congratulate us thinking that we were a couple but before i could correct them, he went along with it by thanking people. I thought it was innocent jokes so i didnt care. 

After the flight, he texted me saying that he still couldn’t believe that we were seated next to each other and claimed it was “fate”. 

A month later I find out that we were both taking the same online college course. I had just given birth so I have a family. Over the course of the semester he texted me everyday talking about his family, what he was doing, and even about his bio mom abandoning him. Our conversations would go on the whole day until 2am. Im up at this time of course cause I have a newborn. I just thought he needed a friend to rant to. Didn’t think too much of it. 

He would ask for pictures of my daughter saying that shes so cute and getting so big and that he couldn’t wait to meet her. 

One day he called me huffing and puffing about how this guy he was supposed to get tattooed from flaked on his appointment. Drew wanted to go to this guys house and fight or whatever. I tried to calm him down. He txted me after thanking me.

"Guys who train/use dumbbells or weights, how much do you regularly lift ?","So I’m just curious what the regular weight that most guys lift is. 

I usually stuck to exclusively body weight exercises but since my parents started supporting me getting into better shape, I’ve been expanding on the range of what I try and do. 

My mother, who has never even been in a gym and is overweight, suggested picking up some weights at a local place. 

So I got a pair of 5LBs and a pair of 10LBs. 

Then my dad (who worked out twice a week over 20 years ago) told me that at 18 I should be lifting atleast 40-50 LB and working towards a minimum of 70LB. Per arm. 

To be honest, I’m actually stronger than I expected myself to be and 10LB is feeling not light but I can barely notice the weight and it takes very little to no effort to do anything with them.

Have any of you guys experienced a painful penis after sex?,"I took some tadalafil tonight to give it a try and admittedly it does indeed make the penis more sensitive and it makes you stay harder for longer. 

I ended up having some great sex and lasted the longest Ive been able to in a long time. But near the end my penis started to throb and not in a good way. It started to feel numb (it wasn’t) and I started getting strange electrical shocks up my urethra. I’m guessing this was all down to my penis staying engorged with blood for a prolonged period?

Now I’m sitting here with what feels like a bruise and swollen penis yet everything looks absolutely fine. 

I think I’ll give the tadalafil a miss from now on.

How does a guy struggling with his finances explains his situation to a new date?,"I have been lurking for a while and this is something that I keep thinking about when it comes to start a new relationship.  I'm a middle aged man, never married but with a young kid from a previous relationship; I have a good job and I'm working hard to try to get a promotion and improve my professional prospect, but due to very questionable financial decision in the past I am barely surviving.

I'm working really hard to get my finances in order and I'm proud of the fact that I paid of one loan and will take care of two (or possibly three) this year; things are looking up but besides the times I spend with my kid I'm mostly alone because I think I can't afford dating.

My last girlfriend and I broke up because we couldn't talk about money; we were both middle aged parents with young kids, but she thought I was ""cheap"" even though I paid for most of our dates.  We enjoyed our time together and got along well with each other kids, but we were both  struggling financially and had diametrically opposite approach to money management.

After that experience I put even more urgency on getting a good grip on my finances; I cut my expenses even more, cut my 401k contributions to the minimum... but mostly spend my free time at home watching TV or reading.   That was depressing (and I struggled with depression for a long time when I was younger) so I updated my dating profile and starting swiping left and right.

Well, a couple of weeks ago a very attractive middle aged divorcee liked what she saw and contacted me; we had a nice conversation and ended up exchanging numbers.  I called her yesterday and agree on going on a date on Friday and I really need your advice on how to approach this situation if we get serious.

I know I shouldn't left past experiences mess up new ones and I know that if a woman tells me that I'm cheap for whatever reason that's a red flag that can't be ignored.   Also important to mention because I think is relevant is that I'm an immigrant to the USA and in my culture the man always pays for everything and even though I'm very assimilated I feel really ashamed to let a lady pay for half the bill when we go out....which is silly, because even my last ex actually paid for some dates herself.

How to proceed with gym crush,"We’ve been going to the same gym for quite a while, but I’ve only noticed in the last couple of months that he’d stare at me. At first, I thought this was maybe by chance, but then it happened too often so I figured there was more to it.  I did one of those smile nod things to him a few times and he’d keep staring. So naturally, I started paying more attention. He would often look over at me from afar and glance over. If I looked back, he’d look away and that happens quite a bit. When we walk passed each other, he wouldn’t make eye contact. Then, in the last week, I noticed he’d actually put his head down when he’d see me approaching from afar, and turn his head away. I asked him last week if he was using these weights by him, and when he saw me approach, he put his head down and just nodded no without speaking or looking up.  I also feel like he’s on nearby machines often or just generally in the same area, but that could also be coincidence. 

I went back and forth on whether I should even say hi.  It seemed like I made him slightly uncomfortable if he can’t make eye contact. Plus, I certainly don’t feel/look that attractive in the gym. Then today, he was getting spotted by my friend so I thought in the least this could make for good conversation.  He was at the machine next to me at the end of my workout, so I finally got the courage to introduce myself. He was super nice and actually not really shy at all.  We talked about our workout for the day and where we’re from in the area and so forth. He even said he noticed how much I can lift and called me strong (which in the least makes me think he wants me to know he’s looked over?).  I said I hope it wasn’t weird that I came up to him and he said he was glad I did and it wasn’t since we see each other practically every weekday. We talked for like 5 minutes and he was actually the one who kept trying to talk more. We shook hands and said we’d see each other tomorrow. 

So I’m just really bad at reading signs, but it kind of seems like he may be interested as well? I want to see how the conversation goes for this week and if we actually do more than just wave, then maybe I’d ask him by the end of the week if he wants to grab a coffee sometime. Should I wait longer than that? Should I try to gauge how interested he actually is/isn’t since we just spoke for the first time? TIA!

When did you start feeling like a grown-ass adult man?,"So the other day I went to the mall. Looking for a new watch, I entered the jewelry store. When talking to the salesperson there, I felt like I was just a teenager who likes shiny stuff walking in, and wasting the salespeople time, but they were taking me as a serious customer. I ended up buying the watch I was looking for. 

I had the same feeling when I bought my car last year. Walking into the dealership and talking to the salesman there, the feeling of being a teenager walking in just cause I like cars that go vroom vroom came back. 

I have the same feeling when I go to my bank, I do adult shit but I sure as hell do not feel like an adult. I still feel like I’m nothing but a curious 15 year old teenager.

Anyway, we continued chatting on tinder and I casually asked her to go out a few times and she avoided the question twice and said ""probably not tonight"" the next...I was specifically asking her to hang out a week in advance.

Is he oblivious or just not into me?,"I've (23f) been talking to this guy (22m) for the last month or so. Met at work and he seemed like a cool dude. I asked him out and gave him my number.

I'm not. But I don't mind any of that. 

I can't guage if he's too awkward/ oblivious to my advances. I've been lightly flirting with him. But I don't really get anything back. So I don't know if he's not into it. Or, if he's just inexperienced with flirting. He said that he's bad and flirting and often can't tell.

So I guess, what do I do now? Do I come on stronger and maybe make a fool of myself? Or back off and stay as friends (which I'm also happy to do, he's a cool guy, I don't mind either way).

How can I clean up mold after a flood in my basement?," Hey all,

So two weeks ago our basement flooded, luckily the basement is unfinished and nothing of value was damage. Now my main concern was once I cleaned up the water, the flood had white fluffy mold growing as the floor was drying. I had a fan and a dehumidifier running the whole time yet mold still formed. This last weekend I ripped up the large area rug that was now garbage and tried to mop the floor with cleaner thinking that would get rid of the mold.... nope. Once the mop water started to dry new mold started forming, same white fluffy stuff as before. Now my main concern is my pregnant girlfriend (she doesn't go in the basement) and my cats as their litter box is in the basement. How can I clean the cement floor without mold growing? I'm in Canada and opening basement windows is not an option to help air out the basement.

What are some effective ways to reignite passion in my relationship?,"Just a little background. My (24F) boyfriend (23M) and I have been together for a little over two years now and I feel like I am the cause for our lack of passion. After recovering from a very traumatic and abusive divorce on my side, we met one another soon after while I was admittedly still healing. I have a son from my previous marriage and we are currently expecting another seedling together. He has completely and wholeheartedly put himself into and accepted the role of being my sons father (birth father is not involved whatsoever), and he is over the moon excited for our little one brewing. I started going to therapy after my marriage concluded and was eventually diagnosed with depression and anxiety. He was there (in my life) for my diagnosis, me first getting on meds, and me being medicated. He has stuck through it all and has endured me and all my baggage. My issue is this-I was a bitch. I was and am still learning to deal with jealousy, anxiety, insecurity, depression, PTSD, and now that I am pregnant, I’ve had to halt all my previously prescribed meds. I feel like all of this has caused him to harden to me a little and become less...in love with me. I know he loves me and our family, but I just feel like I don’t make his eyes glimmer like I used to, and I do not want to lose him. I am realizing the fault in my ways and I want to be better. I still go to therapy and am still healing. We still have sex regularly, maybe 2-3 times a week, definitely not as much as we used to, but I want the connection we used to share. I get glimmers every once in a while but it doesn’t last. What are some ways that I can whoo him again? Or remind him why we fell in love? Maybe little steps I can take towards growth?

"Have you ever turned someone you liked down, but then ignored them? Why?","2 weeks ago, I wrote a post here about confessing to my close guy friend through a letter along with his Christmas present.

My life-long best friend wants to date me.,"I’ve known my best friend since we were kids, we grew up together, then he moved away but visited every summer vacation. He was the first guy I kissed and dated. First time in 7th grade, it went wrong (he liked a friend of mine and kinda dumped me), then in 10th grade (same thing + he was having drug issues and was all over the place and screamed at me and locked me up in a room).

I stopped talking to him after the 2nd dating attempt, he got sober and 2 years later apologised for being such an asshole until I forgave him and we became friends again.

Then once a year or so he asked for another chance to be with me. I always said “no” because I never wanted to get hurt again + he was always judgemental of who I was dating and was always asking for a new chance only after his relationships were failing. He had this romantic idea that we should be together bc we knew each other since we were in diapers. But it felt like a desperate last resort option. I never felt like a priority.

That happened for years until I introduced him to a colleague of mine, 4-5 years ago, and he basically married her after a couple of months of dating. I made up some excuse and did not go to the wedding - I couldnt believe he was so nice with her and with me he never had been, despite me always being there for him. He got upset and we didnt talk for a year, but then we reconnected again and were best friends again. I even visited him and his wife and I was happy for him. He was an emotional wreck before her, had alcohol problems and then he became like the best version of himself. So I understood her personality brought out the best in him and I was trully happy for him.

He was sometimes rubbing it in my face that he could have married me instead, but apart from this, it all seemed awesome until they had a baby and he told me he was cheating on his wife. He said they were not having sex and this was an arrangement they had made.

At the same time, we spent an evening together watching a movie and all of a sudden I started feeling things for him, which totally freaked me out because I had never had any romantic feelings for years for him.  Plus I was seeing someone else. I basically ran away from his flat in the middle of the night. I told him about my feelings and we decided to just move on.

At the baptism of his kid he was super strange - totally ignored me. We still hanged out whenever he visited (we live in different places).Then he called me to wish me a happy NY - which he never does and told me he got a divorce. I was shocked, he seemed so happy with his wife, only mentioned she is bad with money, but nothing more. 

We hanged out and stayed up late drinking and talking. He told me everything about the marriage. And then - AGAIN, hinted at us being together. Told me he doesnt feel as close as he is to me with nobody else and that he had been separated from his wife, but they had kept it private since she was pregnant (so the night we watched the movie and got close he was not with her anymore).

It got me thinking. Should I give this a chance if we happen to both be single at the same time? I am physically atttracted to him, I love him a lot, what happened happened in our teens, now we are in our thirties. But I still have this feeling that he wants more the idea of me and a romantic dream than who I am. And that no matter how convincing he may sound, I should stay the fuck away. All his relationships ended within 4 years time. They all started and ended the same. And he never wanted to go to therapy or do some soul searching.  Just partied until the next one, then got sober again and so on.Now he is still seeing the girl he cheated on with because she totally adores him and he hates being alone. Which I kinda get but I dont know... it feels selfish. And I dont like the way he treats her. Most of the time he is nice to her, but he sometimes treated her like a servant. Or like she is stupid... not ok. She is also much younger than us.

Is it normal for a girl to be super flirty and suggestive in person but really bad when it comes to texting?,"For starters, this girl has been on my d**k for a minute and at first I only considered her a friend because I had met her through one of my friends. She’s been talking about hooking up since the day I met her and she didn’t let up so I did exactly that. We started texting recently and I noticed that it’s not really the same and when I text her it’s like pulling teeth. She usually gives one word responses and when I jokingly told her “I thought guys were supposed to be the ones that were bad at texting” she hits me with “I’m actually pretty good”.

How much does your mindset affect your view of yourself?,"Before I start, I'll preface this by saying I understand that it could be considered vein to care about one's appearance, and that I should just 'get over it' or 'stop giving a \*\*\*'. I'm just looking for some input from other men who may have gone through something similar.

**Onto my post...**

Over the past year, I have made inconsistent but effective changes in my life to try and address certain faults within myself. I have made significant progress when looking back at how I was this time last year. 

I've completely overcome a habitual addiction that had been destroying me for the last 2 years. I've grown socially and emotionally, and I've been working on my self image and how I present myself.

I still have a long way to go, but i'm making progress, slowly but surely.

One of the things I seem to be stuck on is my physical appearance. I've been told i'm good looking and had interest from women. But I can't accept it. I have major insecurities with my looks, and they have always affected my confidence. So much that until last year, when i turned 21, I never let myself entertain the idea of having a romantic partner, Instead I convinced myself that I actually didn't desire any romantic relationships. (when in reality, I was just trying to suppress my worries that I'm not good enough to have one).

**Now onto the main point of my post...**

I noticed that some days, when I look in a mirror, I think I look hideous, and my mood is then affected for the rest of the day. But I noticed that when I'm having a good day, have taken care of myself and my responsibilities, when I look at myself, I see myself as a decently attractive guy. My smile looks better, eyes look more lively, hair seems nicer, my figure even looks improved.

Does having a negative mindset really reflect how you see yourself to that extent? Could most of my worries and insecurities be fed by my negativity and self loathing, which in turn actually makes things seem worse than they really are?

I'm just trying to understand how my opinion of myself can vary so much, all depending on what my current mindset is.

If anyone has any similar experiences, or reading material that could help me understand this situation, I'd really appreciate it. Feels like I'm a bit stuck trying to figure this out.

When do you give a guy a chance and when do you not?,"I tend to snip things in the bud if I get bad vibes from a guy from the start.

I expressed that I didn’t want to go in this weather and why it felt rude of him to ask me to do that. He said he understood and then said “why don’t I plan something next time so it doesn’t inconvenience you?” I declined because the first impression was a bit too much and it didn’t feel like he was apologetic or even realized he was asking too much.

Can you really be platonic friends with someone you slept with and is it ok to hang out with them when you now are with someone else?,"So, I’ve known my boyfriend since August 2018, we’ve dated a few times in the past but this time it’s not casual and we’ve been together for 3 months. When we first met we’d both just gotten out of serious relationships where we’d had our hearts broken. 

He met F around September 2018 and they had a short casual fling and remained friends. I was a little jealous of her (never met her and personally don’t think she’s attractive but he obviously did). So they’ve not been in a relationship and they haven’t (as far as I’m aware) had a sexual encounter for over a year. In that time we dated for a few months but it wasn’t good timing as we both were still messed up from the serious relationships, and then he dated someone else entirely for four months. So I knew he was still friends with F and didn’t care much until we started dating again towards the end of last year. We got back together because it was a better time for us both and the feelings never faded. 

We told each other we love each other, a big deal for us both having only said it in serious relationships before. I brought up F for some reason and he told me he wishes they never had a sexual relationship because they’re really good friends and she helped him through his break up and he values her friendship. Fine, not ideal as I have no experience with guys having female friends they’ve got a history with, but I have to accept it. 

Anyway, I have a history of overthinking and he knows this. He’s always been completely honest about something if I ask him a question, which i really appreciate but I found out from a Facebook post that she tagged him in that he’d been at hers in the last few months. I asked him about it calmly and he said ‘yeah, I was there around November I think?’ And I asked why he hadn’t told me before or if he lied about it and he said ‘I didn’t lie, I just didn’t mention it. It didn’t come up, I don’t tell you every time I hang out with the boys and I didn’t want you to over think’ but that’s really upset me. He said he realises he should have told me (in fairness i think it was before we told each other how we felt and before things became more serious where were now talking about a future together) and that in future he will mention it just so I feel included and know that he’s not being shady or hiding anything. 

I genuinely believe from his point of view that there’s no feelings there, if there was then he’s had the past year to start things up again. However, he told me that she’s made it clear she’s interested in him by asking if we’re still together and when he said yes she’s responded by saying ‘damn’ (this, as far as I know, was after they last hung out, I think she said this recently). 

I mean, in general guys is normal to hang out with a girl you’ve slept with but have no feelings or attraction to, one on one? They hung out at her house and had a takeaway and watched a film. I just can’t wrap my head around this and don’t want to be naive but at the same time I’ve never had a boyfriend who’s had female friends he actually hangs out with like that, and I don’t have guy friends that I hang out with alone regularly if that makes sense. 

I don’t want to make him feel like he can’t be her friend, I don’t want to be controlling or anything. But I’m uncomfortable with them having out again knowing now that she still likes him and quite frankly, I just don’t get it. I don’t see why they would need to meet up and hang out and do what we do minus the sex when he has me?

Can you help me to understand a different perspective please?

I’m not sure why I come across feminine/gay,"How to come across more masculine?

I’m wondering if anyone has any tips on becoming more masculine? 
I’ve constantly been mistaken for gay my entire teenage life. I’m almost 19 and have never had a girlfriend. 
I’m not sure what it is about me that makes me seem gay, I guess I subconsciously act in a feminine way. I think I may make quick movements while interacting with people. For example, if I were sitting down somewhere and someone come up next to me and said hello, I would quickly turn my neck to them subconsciously. Is stuff like that a feminine trait? 
I don’t have a gay voice, I’ve always been told it’s deep. I think a contributing factor to my femininity is the fact that I was raised by women primarily, my mother and my grandmother. My father died when I was very young, and thus I didn’t grow up with much of a masculine role model.

I don’t have a gay voice, I’ve always been told it’s deep. I think a contributing factor to my femininity is the fact that I was raised by women primarily, my mother and my grandmother. My father died when I was very young, and thus I didn’t grow up with much of a masculine role model. 

Please suggest some tips on how I can become more masculine? What are some typically feminine mannerisms guys use that make them seem gay?"
How does an adult man work through a fear of intimacy? Have any of you overcome this?,"Fear of intimacy, meaning, a fear of being physical vulnerable with someone. Wanting affection and sex but being afraid to act on your desires or express what you want without intense discomfort, anxiety or panic.

My main struggle is that I just want a partner I trust and can be safe with to figure this stuff out with, but it doesn't seem fair to burden someone with that baggage, if you could even find someone with that patience in the first place.

"""Better to have loved and lost than to not love at all"".","It's been probably 6 or 7 years since I've seen this girl in person but to be frank she's always been on my mind in one way or another. We used to text each other all the time and even hangout by ourselves occasionally but I was always too afraid to make a move. I always wonder if it was due to my insecurity and feeling she was completely out of my league but what kills me inside to most is that the more I think about it, the more I think what wasted opportunity I had.

I was into her the minute I met her and even through my insecurity I managed to get her number, visited her house and she visiting mine. We would even talk about sex and fantasize about being together however we would both always chalk it up to joking around. But even through all that I let her slip through the cracks, without even a kiss. I feel I'm the direct example of the Shakespearean adage of ""Better to have loved and lost than to never love at all"", with me obviously being an example of the later.

"To all the guys who are outgoing, how can I become more like you?","Hello gentlemen.

I’m 21 and currently living with my parents, fresh out of college. With tons of more time on my hands and single (although my heart does belong to a special someone), I’ve always wanted to be a little more social or outgoing. 

I’ve always been a good kid growing up. No drugs or alcohol, never around the wrong crowd, did his homework and studied and did well in school, but I always seemed to prefer indoors rather than the nightlife or whatever. 

I think I’ve always thought that I’m a good person, but severely lacking in the social department. Yet, I’ve never really been attracted to partying or clubbing or drinking or anything. Even when I’ve been offered the chance to go to any of these things, I refuse. Some people see this as abnormal due to my age, but I’m unsure about that. 

To add a little more personal details, I’ve been to a couple of parties, but they’re not really my thing. I was actually bored, even with a little alcohol in my system. I guess I’m boring? But I don’t want to be like that forever, so how can be more outgoing? Or is there something wrong with me for not liking what most people my age like to do?

What is the thought process of a taken grown man liking every single thing a woman he’s not dating posts? Especially more risqué pictures,"I’m not in a relationship but I’m just genuinely curious.

Pain after long period of arousal without ejaculating?,"Hi,

I'm a 31 yo gay male, and a few months I started dating this guy I'm really into and super attracted by.  

Recently we spent a 7 day vacation together during which we were in each other's presence all day long.   It was also the first time I went on a relatively long vacation with someone I am dating and liking so much.  We would have sex in the morning then go out and have sex at night again and do fun activities during the day.  

The thing is that, in the period between morning and evening sex, I was constantly excited.  Since we had sex around 9 am and then again around 11 pm, I basically had a boner that would go one and off for 13 hrs (say 30 min on, 30 min off). 

The first day this happened it was quite fun.  I was excited to be so excited, but then I started to feel pain at the basis of the penis, at a +/-45 degree angle in the direction of the abdomen.  It would hurt on touch, diminish when seated, and gradually disappear after ejaculation.

Maybe some of you will get a kicker out of this, but is this normal? Is this what people refer to as blue balls?

I'm a bit worried this might be causes by some prostate provlems, so I thought I could consult the wisdom of the collective and see if anyone had experienced the same, or had any either anecdotal or professional knowledge that could help me.

Am I needy for wanting more interaction (texting),"Backstory: I (26F) have been dating a guy (27M) for about 2 months now. It's kinda long distance, we live an hour apart and only see each other on the weekends/every other weekend. He warned me beforehand that he's not a consistent texter/this has been a problem with his exes. He's made it clear that if I get frustrated by it, let him know. But he'll go 12-18 hrs before responding sometimes and I don't feel comfortable telling him every few days that I need more interaction. I know he's on his phone all the time so a quick ""I'm thinking about you"" would suffice. 

At first, he made a huge effort to interact, it think it was the whole ""chase"" phase. But things moved kinda quickly and now it's pretty much implied we're together (met his whole fam, bought me a toothbrush for his place, his mom loves me, etc.). So now he makes much less of an effort and I'm happy if I get 1 or 2 responses a day. 

Anyway, this weekend I've been incredibly ill, even ended up in the hospital for a brief stay. I've barely heard from him. I know he's concerned for me but only because he sent a breiyf text saying so. The thing is, things are 100% different when were together, he's extremely attentive, loving, interested in me, always caressing, introduced me to this whole friend group and coworkers. No doubt he's interested, but I just don't understand why he leaves me unread for hours upon hours. Am I too needy? 

TL;DL dating a guy who lives an hour away and warned me about being a horribly texter. I didn't  1-3 replies/day is generous. He explicitly said to tell him when I get frustrated but I feel like that's be naggy. Recently very ill/brief hospital stay and he only send a few texts to check in on me.

How do you curb that post-date anxiety when you're waiting for her to get back to you in regards to another date?,"Hey my guys. I'm really at a loss here as to what to do.

I went on a date on Saturday night, and it went well, she was my type, conversation flowed easy, and we made out heaps. Looking back now I realised I wasn't asked a single question about myself (Don't know if that's a red flag or what). I sent her a ""I made it home safe"" text, and it got left on read.

But anyways, she needed some time to think about if we'd have a second date. So I've left her to it, and I'm just sitting here going crazy. I sort of figured she would have gotten back to me the next day, and I told her I wouldn't contact her until she'd come back to me first.

I don't know what to do with my brother.,"My brother has been stealing from me and he won't stop despite me telling him multiple times not to. It's nothing big, it's been booze and using my dry herb vape and my weed. But it's been a constant thing over a long while that's built up with tons of other things he does to piss me off. He usually pays me back but he never says sorry. I feel like my privacy has been violated and he doesn't respect me in anyway. I keep having to hide my things, but when I'm not home he'll keep searching my room and taking them. He's of age, earns more money than me but still he persists. 

We still live at home with our parents and they been paying a lot of money for neurological appointments for him due to him having his own mental problems. He's told me weed puts him in a dark place and it undoes the progress that appointments have done for him and he that he doesn't smoke it anymore. Which is a complete lie. I've almost gotten kicked out for the house for having weed, despite it being legal here. So ""tattling"" on him isn't really an option as I feel I would be the one locked out and he wouldn't face any consequences. 

I know this may seem small to most of you but the constant ignoring what I'm telling him not to do and just leave me along is getting really infuriating.",AskMen,"I don't know what to do with my brother.My brother has been stealing from me and he won't stop despite me telling him multiple times not to.

How do you tactfully tell a guy his cum tastes like death? How do you know yours doesn’t?,"I seriously think this dude is sick. It’s absolutely repulsive. I’ve tried all the internet advice about different foods, he’s perfectly clean and his dick tastes fine but the cum is rancid AF.

How do you get over a breakup,"So this isn’t like a terrible breakup where we never want to see each other again or anything. No scandals happened. She sat me down yesterday and she confessed that due to a sexual abusive relationship she was scared of commitment. She had unwantingly broken us up in the past just to say she was wrong, and I, who loves this girl more than anyone else I had met, knew she never wanted to breakup up. I love her and she literally pulled me out of depression. What can I do to come to terms that we’re no longer together but are still gonna be around each other.

Ex ignored my apology,"Ok, so I DMed an ex of long ago to ask for old band pictures (he was in a band with friends of mine). We made small talk some, and I sent an inappropriate (sexual)message. I was having bad mental health problems at the time and am married. I felt so horrible about this. He said he wasn't interested as he was in a relationahip.  I sent another message apologizing. He ignored it, so I sent another message. He asked me to stop messaging him. I had originally wanted to collaborate on this project with him, and messaged him about it. No answer. I messaged again, no answer. I messaged again, and he said he wasn't interested.

A month later I accidentally messaged him on Insta as his name on my DM list was above a friend's and I accidentally clicked on it. I messaged him and asked him to delete our conversation. No answer. So I messaged directions as he is not too tech savvy. No answer. I finally got annoyed and said that I knew he was ignoring me and probably thought I was a piece of hot garbage but could he please delete our conversation. He wrote back and said he deleted it and that he was blocking me necause I had no understanding of boundaries or personal space.

Around this time I was hospitalized and got a stern lecture from my doctor to start taking the correct dosage of my antidepressant (I had started taking less to save money as I didn't have insurance at the time). Not being on the right dosage made me act irrational, obsessive and inappropriate.

I messaged him with a very long apology. I never respected his wishes and apologized for acting how J did. I explained the antidepressants and the hospitalization. No answer.

I have been getting way too comfortable with myself. How do I change it?,"When I was 20, I was a guy who hated myself - I never liked the way I looked. Was never happy with my lack of skills, etc. Over the course of two years, I've built great confidence and self-esteem. I am great with people, have productive hobbies and doing fairly well at college. I am fortunate to have an amazing girlfriend (of four years) who has helped me a lot with life. As of now, I'm starting to focus a bit on my social life too.
However, I have noticed that since 5-6 months, I've been growing super lazy and comfortable with who I am.
I eat whatever pleases my taste buds. The moment my brain thinks it needs to do something, I enter the Netflix and Video-games realm. Outside college, my productivity is almost zero. I've lost touch with fitness - I can barely climb 2 flights of stairs without running out of breath.
In 5 months, I'll be graduating. I'm scared the real world won't be this easy and I need to get back into a life of more discipline. But my drive... Its missing. Initially, I used to have the need to impress people, but now that's gone. I have developed a 'happy-go-lucky' attitude which I really want to change.
What would your advice be?

How do I stop feeling overwhelmed about everything all the time?,"I'm feeling so anxious at the time of writing this. I just get this feeling of anxiety get overwhelmed and this loneliness feeling a lot. I study in at uni in England, but I'm still home in my country because uni starts in a week from now, so I'm still in my country. That means I haven't properly worked out in over a month. And I really miss actually lifting weights and not just doing push ups in my room or small dumbbell exercises. I'm really insecure about a lot of things. My height, me feeling small, how I appear to others, what first impression do I give to others etc. This Christmas period has been super stressful, I haven't been able to feel Christmas because of all of the assignments that I had. I was studying on Christmas Eve, on New Year's Eve, on New Year's day.. From Web Programming (HTML CSS PHP SQL) to Object Oriented Programming to 2000 word essays. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not all, I'm the kind of person who helps everyone.. I had to redo some of these assignments twice to help my friends because they aren't so good at programming and always kept calling me to help them and of course I did, sometimes at the expense of my time. But I don't really care about that because I love helping my friends. It just gets really exhausting after a while. I can't seem to be able to take a break from things. My dating life has been quite shit. I've been on two dates since I broke up with my ex. The first girl ghosted me. Second girl we weren't really compatible which is fine. I keep thinking of how I broke up with my ex and the very next day she blocked me off Facebook so she could add that she was in a relationship with some other dude since May... (broke up with her late August) Was probably cheating for longer though and that just feels horrible.. I moved on though, it's just that I sometimes remember this and ask myself how could she have done that... I haven't had any luck finding any internships or placements so far.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've been to so many interview's and I've received so many coding tests from companies to complete. Worst of all are ""video interviews"" where basically a question pops in your screen and you have 3 minutes to record your reply.. just so companies don't spent time to actually interview someone, but this seems so unatural and I get sooo stressed and I just can't do anything. This week I had this coding challenge from this company to create a whole fully functional working ANDROID APP (had to learn everything by myself) which gets data from a json file, through a phpmyadmin database through a php file in a week. The same week I had to write 2000 word essay, and had friends/coursemates who would call me to hang in a cafe so I could help them start their own essay. I managed to do everything, at the expense of me feeling overwhelmed. I can't seem to find any luck with any girl as well, and this bothers me so much in all honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

 I hate getting ghosted, texting someone for some time, asking them out and they just always can't. I feel since girls have so many guys to choose from, they just go for the best, and obviously I am not the best, I'm not some 6'5 super jacked dude. Same goes for companies, they will hire the best person out of everyone, the one who knows more things than just what is taught in uni. And that's not all, I've even tried to compete, through the past 2 summers I created a videogame myself to make atleast some kind of ""project"" to show that I have work outside of uni... I started playing League again but that game stresses me also sooo much. Life is hard.. I'm really sorry, I feel sorry. I wish my life was more comfortable, I wish I had a job to have some sort of income myself.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents provide me with everything they can, at the cost of them having a comfortable lifeas well, by paying for my studies, my food, everything.. and I don't like that feeling, I wanna give something back. I know you'll say that's what parents should do, and while I agree, I just wish I could help the situation a little bit too you know? One of my 2020 goals was to start a youtube channel to just improve with my insecurities and fears and become more confident in myself.. sucks being 5'6 at 136lbs (although workout).. oh about working out..

What does a kiss feel/taste like?,"First a little context (will reveal my age at the end of this explanation). I'm no stranger to saying goodbye to people I know I will never see or hear anything from again, and I've never stayed in one place long enough to form an intimate relationship with anybody. With that being said, I see it very difficult for me to commit to a relationship in the near future. In the first place, the only thing that mattered to me growing up was going to school and coming home to help take care of my two younger sisters, do chores (laundry, dishes, cutting grass, etc.) and I never owned a car until just three years ago and have never been insured automotive or medical, and this year I have worked at my job to the point where I will finally afford auto insurance in the next month. I still live with my dad, his girlfriend, and her 17 and 15-year-old daughters in a house we moved into four months ago, but I pay the utilities while he pays for remodeling the house. A lot of things in my life have prevented me from forming a stable relationship with anyone I cared about or was interested in, and this year I want to change that. I'm currently writing a book that I plan to have edited by mid-February so in between my job, my book, and my home situation, I've not had many opportunities to get to know anybody intimately. I've tried Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, Hily, POF, even Taimi, but what's the point of using any of those apps if you've never had a friend take a photo of you before? I've gone out to a couple of night clubs by myself plenty of times but no matter how much I dance or drink, I can't help but feel empty by the end of the night. So I want to know, just to socially motivate myself in what to strive for the next time I go out to make (more like an attempt to make) a friend or even something more, I want to know one thing; what does it feel/taste like to kiss or to be kissed?

What is the best way to tell my husband I want to have sex with women?,"Hi, men of Reddit! I created an account specifically to ask this question.

My husband is awesome, and I absolutely adore him. We’re very much in love, and our sex life is rockin’.

That said, my husband’s in his thirties and I’m in my twenties, and I have a ravenous sexual appetite for women that I want to continue exploring while I’m still young and sexy. I’m a petite woman with very big natural tits, and women have always been so much better at handling my breasts and helping me achieve climax through tit-play. My husband’s great in bed, but I find myself constantly fantasizing about having another woman suck on my nipples and massage my clit.

So, all of that said, I want to talk to my husband about inviting women into our sex life. However, he’s a little bit territorial in the sense that he doesn’t like to “share” me, regardless of what gender we’re discussing. Therefore, I guess I’m looking for some advice about how to best approach the conversation? In other words, how would you want to be approached by your partner about something like this? How should I express that I love our sex life, but I miss the variety involved with eating pussy and having women press their tits up against mine?

How do you know if you should stop pursuing a girl?,"So here's my situation: I've known this girl for about three years now, we are together in a band, but outside of that we never actually spent time alone together untill recently. I've had a crush on her for a while now, but didn't want to make a move, because she didn't seem to be interested in me. But a couple weeks ago we were kinda forced to hang out by chance for a couple of hours and it was really great, we were talking about a lot of different things and laughed at each other a lot and all that stuff. So i decided i should ask her out for a coffee or something, i did, she said yes, we hung out, it was really cool. I didn't make any moves, we just had a fun time. Then we started texting, it seemed ok at first, but then it turned really onesided, me sending stuff and her responding (although the responses seemed enthusiastic, they didn't lead the convo anywhere). Our schedules are really packed and most of the week we are in different cities, so i asked her out for coffee again the next week, she said yes. It was cool again, we were both really tired after a long day, but it was still fun. Knowing that we are in the same city the next day i suggested that she called me if she had any time. She did not. But ok, that didn't matter to me much. I saw a movie playing that day in the cinema in town and asked her if she had time, she said she was busy and nothing else. I then suggested another date when the movie was playing next week and she said yes. We had a little bit of contact during the week through texts, but it was still mostly one sided. So the day comes, she was working a bit late and came to the caffe about half an hour before the movie started, so we didn't have that much time to talk before the movie but it was still nice. Then after the movie she just said she needs to go, so it ended really weirdly. She was feeling a bit under the weather though, so it was kinda understandable. And she sent me a text saying she is sorry when she came home. The next day when ended up still texting a little bit, but then the convo died out again.

It was cool again, we were both really tired after a long day, but it was still fun. Knowing that we are in the same city the next day i suggested that she called me if she had any time. She did not. But ok, that didn't matter to me much. I saw a movie playing that day in the cinema in town and asked her if she had time, she said she was busy and nothing else. I then suggested another date when the movie was playing next week and she said yes. We had a little bit of contact during the week through texts, but it was still mostly one sided. So the day comes, she was working a bit late and came to the caffe about half an hour before the movie started, so we didn't have that much time to talk before the movie but it was still nice. Then after the movie she just said she needs to go, so it ended really weirdly. She was feeling a bit under the weather though, so it was kinda understandable. And she sent me a text saying she is sorry when she came home. The next day when ended up still texting a little bit, but then the convo died out again. I really like this girl, but i am really confused if she likes me back or not, it's really hard to tell. Sorry for the long read, have a good one!"
I (22F) think my shy male flatmate likes me but not sure.," Long story short, I (22F) moved into a house with two guys (let’s call them Person A and Person B) who are childhood best friends. Both of them are in their mid-to-late 20s. Person A is a lot more outspoken than Person B, and Person B, in my opinion, is a bit more shy around me cause he always fidgets and walks around everywhere whenever I speak to him alone. 

There are various reasons why I keep getting a gut feeling that he likes me: 

* he’s always curious on where I’m going in the evenings/weekends, and who with 
* he’s relatively protective about me (e.g. when I was really drunk at my birthday he wasn’t the nicest to my guy friends who were taking care of me when he came to pick me up to bring me home)
* whenever we’re in a group setting, he would always find the opportunity to flirt with me (e.g. making jokes about stuff I’ve done, and tease me for stupid things). If not, he would always speak to them about me. 
* I’ve caught him look at me a few times and noticed that he glances at me all the time whenever I’m looking at something else
* he remembers the small things about me (remembering that I like sticky toffee pudding, etc) 
* he’s never spoken to me about relationships/dates/girls. 
* whenever my friends try and flirt with him he would always look straight at me even when it comes to answering their questions. 
* whenever I speak to him there's always a prolonged eye contact that I can't seem to pinpoint on. 
* he always laughs at whatever I do, and he also blushes whenever I speak to him.
* before Christmas he told me he got presents for people he cared a lot about. And on Christmas I found out that he actually got me and Person A each an individually wrapped present. The present itself is a bag with an image of two bunnies kissing. 

But there are also reasons why I think he’s not into me: 

* he would come back home and go straight to his room 
* he prefers to hang out with our other Person A alone rather than alone with me. 
* he sometimes looks quite uncomfortable/bothered when I speak to him which I don't know if it's just him being moody. 

I just need some advice about this because I also think he is quite cute. Personally I don’t really want to make a move but I just want to know without asking him if he actually feels something for me. My friend spoke to him on my birthday party when he came to pick me up and apparently he was telling her how cute I was that night - plus she also said that she picked up a vibe from him that he has something for me. I’ve told my friends about this and most of them have said either there’s ‘something there’ or he has a ‘soft spot’ for me. Thoughts?

Should I marry her?,"I love this girl, but I’m not sure. We’re both 35 and in a long distance relationship so I am feeling a little pressure to make up my mind. Since this is a serious question this won’t be short, but I am at a loss and would appreciate any advice.

About a year ago I lost my job. I’m born in the states but have Croatian roots with tons of family there, so I decided no better time to see family then when you don’t have to book a return ticket. So I did. 

Along the way I met a Croatian girl who seemed absolutely amazing.... She was sweet, she had a successful business, she spoke my language and seemed to share common values. I had a 6-figure job in the states and I live in the south where it’s common for women to date men for their financial support so they could be stay at home wives, so the fact that we would go to dinner and this girl would pay for our bill while I was in the restroom made a huge impression. Plus she cooks, cleans, washes clothes, irons, gets me presents but perhaps the most defining aspect of this relationship to me is: We’ve never been in an argument despite how BRUTALLY honest I am... Because I was a traveler, I moved in with her 3 weeks in to the relationship. Got a job, stayed for 6 months and every day was so pleasant because it was Croatian beaches, and NO arguing or relationship stress! 

The only issue is the sexual chemistry is not on par with other girls I’ve dated. I’ve never liked the way she kissed from the first moment and I don’t really ever “lust” for her. I’m a healthy male and she is an attractive 5’4 blonde so we have regular sex 2-4 times a week along with a great social life. We travel, go out, she is supportive etc. and while I check out other girls all the time, our sex is not bad and the ease and regularity that I get it keeps me from straying. Also, I love and respect her and I wouldn’t cheat on her....

Now living in Croatia for 9 months I explained that the economy and opportunities don’t compare. I explained that if I and we wanted to have a life and future and provide the best for children in the future it would not be in Croatia... So 10 months later I moved back trying to start a franchise with my savings in order to support her. We now live 7 times zones away and the plan is for her to find a way to sell her business while I ramp up and then she comes here, but I’m getting cold feet.

She doesn’t know too much English (I’m sure she’ll learn) but I brought her for a tour in the summer and she loved it. Honestly she’d make a perfect mother and a great match for me. I lean towards the skeptic/negative side and she so positive, supportive and caring. She’s great with kids and she knows my culture/language/religion and we don’t argue (I’ve tried). She is cute but I always wanted 5’8 brunette and she’s a 5’4 blonde whose kiss doesn’t turn me on...

She has her own successful business in Croatia and all her family is there so it’s asking a lot for her to leave it... and I don’t want to do that to her if things did not go well in our marriage...

Fellow males why is my perspective on women different and dating became harder?,"Yeah a somewhat misleading double title.
But what I simply want to ask is have you ever experienced a change in your perspective on your taste for future partners and dating game after a relationship with a women whom you really loved but who dumped you? 

In my case it's that now being in my mid twenties I don't care about just having a good looking GF or FWB thing anymore but instead I want someone who has more attributes like a solid income, maybe experience with living on their own, finished university, is loyal and rather a positive person, has no past traumas to project on me and the list goes on. I'm back in dating and it's just so hard to find someone in their 20s who ticks a few points off this list. Sometimes I think going to clubs, bars and stuff isn't the right place to start with. Also tinder and other dating apps became quite shallow. I 2014 and 2018 both times where I freshly came out of a relationship I didn't have to use such things since women where either hitting on me or showed obvious interest. I think I have to learn to approach and find the right spots to meet people.

I just don't understand why I'm not interested in casual stuff anymore and my perspective has changed so much. Is that something that comes with age and experience? I don't see this happening with my friends.

My GF is weighing me down with her suicidal thoughts and aggression.,"Hear me out. When we first started dating, up until now (which has been a year and 5 months) shes always been so aggressive by nature and a disrespectful person when shes mad. She always wants her way and is not accommodating to my pov in any arguments. She always “gets what im saying” but then she continues to push her way across. And if i get even the slightest of upset or angry she gets suicidal thoughts because she doesnt feel loved, even though her mental health has been taking the biggest toll on me. Its hard knowing she hurts herself because “ i dont know how to solve problems” or that “you never do things right”  i dont know what to do, this is my first love and relationship and i really wish this would work out but it seems like it doesnt. This whole relationship feels like toxic fights, an overwhelming amount of sacrifices. She wants me to behave like a b and c, but she doesnt. I dont know if i want to leave her because i wNt shit to work out, and i dont wamt her killing herself if i leave which could be a possibility. Mentally im so fucking drained i cant take this bullshit anymore. She gies to counselling but never lives up to the principles they teach her to make her better . And personally ive bene her councillor for a long while and she doesnt do the shit i say either to change. And our fights last a lifetime, she drags our fights on for weeks...

What do girls want most on the first date!?,"To be at ease and smile. 

In my experience, if you can make a girl smile and laugh a lot you have a better chance of having a smooth first date and also a better chance of seeing them again. 

Smiling and laughing brings about a sense of ease and comfort and first dates can be tense at times, so ease that tension by keeping light playful energy with them. 

I have found that the most effective jokes are at your own expense, so the girl has a 'free' chance to laugh :) 

After all, girls just wanna have fun!

For some reason she was explaining everything to me like if i were some sort of retarded kid(at least that was what i understood by the way she was speaking to me) and she told me that for next time (next day i think) she told that she was going to bring her ipad and proceeded to explain to me what it was, at the time i felt pretty offended by it and she noticed so tried to apologize for it. I don't remember if it was the same day or the day after that a manage to stop studying together without telling here that was partially because of what she told me.

"Men who regularly approach women, what's the story of your most memorable failed attempts?","Here's mine.

Some time ago, I was out shopping with my cousins and decided to leave them to look around because they were taking too long. I head over to a nearby coffee shop and spot a really hot girl seating alone.

Now in my experience, seeing a hot girl, especially one thats alone is incredibly rare, so I thought to myself, ""damn this is my chance, don't fuck it up!"" (I fucked it up). So I did a quick fix of my hair, rolled up my sleeves and confidently walked towards her.

As I was walking towards she notices me and puts up her guard, and as soon as I say ""Hi"" she blurts out, in the bitchiest way you can imagine.

""Ugh, I have a boyfriend.""

Now I've experienced it enough times that girls can lie about that, and to some of them its just a test. I was prepared for this.... or so I thought....

I was sweating,

I could feel the fear creeping in my whole body..

and by the sound of her tone, it felt threatening

My mind went blank and so I just blurted out whatever my mind first thought...

So in a fearing, unmanly way...

I said,

""Oh, me too..""

I could do nothing but laugh at my own embarrassment as I walk out the coffee shop, only to embarrass myself further by going back in because I forgot to order my coffee, trying to go about my day like nothing happened.

Anyway, thats my most memorable failed attempt. At least now both the girl and I have a great ""me too"" story to tell.",AskMen,"Men who regularly approach women, what's the story of your most memorable failed attempts?Here's mine.

Some time ago, I was out shopping with my cousins and decided to leave them to look around because they were taking too long. I head over to a nearby coffee shop and spot a really hot girl seating alone.

Now in my experience, seeing a hot girl, especially one thats alone is incredibly rare, so I thought to myself, ""damn this is my chance, don't fuck it up!"" (I fucked it up). So I did a quick fix of my hair, rolled up my sleeves and confidently walked towards her.

As I was walking towards she notices me and puts up her guard, and as soon as I say ""Hi"" she blurts out, in the bitchiest way you can imagine.

""Ugh, I have a boyfriend.""

Now I've experienced it enough times that girls can lie about that, and to some of them its just a test. I was prepared for this.... or so I thought....

I was sweating,

I could feel the fear creeping in my whole body..

and by the sound of her tone, it felt threatening

My mind went blank and so I just blurted out whatever my mind first thought...

So in a fearing, unmanly way...

I said,

""Oh, me too..""

How to grow into being my own man?,"**TL;DR:** I'm a young adult with daddy issues who really needs advice or some perspective on being more content in masculinity and growing into my gay, non-gender-conforming self, past validating myself with others' opinions.

Hey, AskMen, I'm a young guy who really has had trouble expressing myself being a guy and stuff. I've tried to dismiss it as gender not meaning much to me, but like other times I've lied to myself, this denial is hurting my life and emotional stability.

Generally, I've been considered an emotional and ""feminine"" male, which while not completely incorrect has caused me bullying over the years that has eroded security in my own presentation of being a male. I've been trying to strengthen my identity, but with no prominent positive male role models in my life, I feel lost. Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is the closest thing to a caring dad I have.

Thing is, I feel horrible even saying I want a male role model. I've always wanted to be an individual with my own identity separate from race, gender, sexuality, etc., but I'm realizing those are parts of myself that I connect with. I want to be accepted along with my identit***ies***, not despite them.

All this confusion has gotten to the point where I have sent other guys nudes of myself, just for validation that I'm attractive or worthy in some way (not forcefully mind you, I'd hate myself even more for that). I know that sounds crazy, but the validation from other guys that I'm ""guy-enough"" for them was pleasurable past the sexual aspect. I guess that's ""daddy"" issues for ya.

Also, because I don't have any not-stereotypically-masculine male role models, I'm not even sure how to style my afroamerican hair that I'm trying to grow out that will hopefully help me tackle some parts of my own identity.

All of this probably comes from my family who--as an example of their character--asked me ***twice***, **fearfully**, if I was ***\*gasp\**** **gay**, while I asked for therapy for my depressive symptoms arising from my past, family situation, and identity troubles (not that I told them all that or even that I'm gay).

So, yeah, I'm not sure what I'm doing with myself as a man. I want to be male, but I'm not sure how to live a happy life that way. I have some surprisingly supportive friends for a rural, Christian town, but I'm still scared, hesitant, unsure, etc. Typical feelings for post-teen pre-adults, I'm sure, but it's all the more real nonetheless. Any advice and anecdotes are appreciated\~

Would like advice.,"I work with a girl. She shows a lot of interest in me. Found out she has a fiancé. She never talks about him. She tries to flirt with me a lot, hits me a lot (playfully), says double entendre a lot. I don't want to be a homewrecker so I try to just be nice but I have to admit I flirt a little bit and appreciate the attention.  


At work she did something small for me and said something along the lines of 'if I have to do this (insert thing that would take 5 seconds to do) again you owe me a coffee' so I had to have her do it again and she stared at me looking serious about her 'offer' and I didn't know what to do so I just brushed it off laughing awkwardly. I don't want to help her cheat, but idk the best way to tell her how I feel, especially in a work setting where we have almost no private time to talk. I also don't know if I should even consider going somewhere with her (I'll probably have to drive us, she has no car right now) and Im not even sure if they live together, or if its okay to even get coffee with someone who is engaged at all since, personally I have always decided to never do anything even remotely close to cheating when I was in a relationship.  


Honestly I feel dumb about not knowing the perfect course of action in this situation. I should know better but really don't know the protocol.

How To Get Over Being Stood Up?,"Hey everyone, these past couples of days have been a whirlwind of emotions.

So I entered my second semester of college a few weeks ago and went out of my to talk to women(I never dated beforehand). Many times, these women wouldn't show the same interest back and it never went anywhere. However, I met this one girl from my Chem lecture and we quickly bonded over the past two weeks. 

I finally pulled the trigger last Friday and asked her out to lunch after our Chem lecture. I was super nervous, but she agreed! I can't tell you how happy I was when she said yes. All of my guy freinds made a big deal about it and congratulated me (I know, it's cringe but it was my first date haha)

I texted her yesterday afternoon asking when she was available for Tuesday. She didn't reply back all day yesterday, even though she was snapchatting, and finally sent a response this morning. She basically said she wasn't into me and didn't see us more than freinds. She said she only said yes in the heat of the moment to not make it awkward.

Of course, I feel awful, but how can I get over this? My confidence(which was already low) is at an all time low.

Should I do d*ck move and break up? Judgments welcome,"  

TLDR: M20 thinking about abandoning relationship to try other things.  
  

Well, I am 20-year-old male and often I am unintentionally d\*ck person. I mean, I have girlfriend, we met in summer and it was the most awesome summer ever for both of us. We went camping several times and etc. Then we started university, my girlfriend had random sadness and anger issues and she always said things that made me so upset, that I had to turn my phone off to not think about that.... Well, once I went at my university course (it was like 3 day stay at school, sports, dance and etc.) and I just had to turn off my phone again... I was so upset and went to have dance with my friends (it was better than sitting somewhere alone and sad.) I am not party guy but if I do party with my friends, I can do all the crazy dances and etc… and then I ended up on slow dance with girl (there was nothing wrong with it, we were just chatting and got dancing together just by accident... BUT there was a spark between us, like huge spark and we actually spend rest of the night smiling at each other and talking (but still, just as friends, no flirting and anything like that), it was nice but I was sure I want to stay with my gf.... But that spark never left me (and never left her)... She knows I am in relationship and when I tried to turn her down, she said she really likes who I am, my personality and she is going to wait. She is the kindest person I know and even thou she is not the sharpest one ( but honestly, I am also not the sharpest too), she is super hard working (I can brain out lot of things without much effort, but she can learn anything she wants (she has a strong will))  
   
 

3 Months later, me and my gf had really hard time understanding each other, we broke up and I just started to talk to THAT girl again and bought her flower just to make her happy (there was no date but it was still d\*ck move in my mind). Well one month after breakup my exgf wrote me, we started chatting and I decided I want to try that relationship again, because of that awesome summer. We are still together, I doesn’t work perfectly, especially while we are chatting (I am quite a busy person, I have my work as IT specialist and also I do tech help, web development, develop my own arduino solutions and repair/build laptops/PCs, graphics stuff and etc. so chatting is must and we were together for ""only"" about 20 hours a week). 

 And now I am here, we are arguing a lot while chatting but most of time when we are together, everything is fine and we are quite happy together. I think our personalities are ""incompatible"" in long run, and after one pregnancy scare, I realized I am not sure if she is my person for life (I would never leave her if she would be pregnant), but I don´t want to break up with her (actually half of me wants to break up because I am not sure if she is the correct person for me (she is crazily unproductive, stubborn, often lazy, don´t like to study but also loving and intelligent person)). 

I know, I was/am d\*ck person, but I don´t do that intentionally, often it is just random bad luck and lack of ""what could go wrong"" thinking.",AskMen,"Should I do d*ck move and break up? Judgments welcome  

TLDR: M20 thinking about abandoning relationship to try other things.  
  

Well, I am 20-year-old male and often I am unintentionally d\*ck person. I mean, I have girlfriend, we met in summer and it was the most awesome summer ever for both of us. We went camping several times and etc. Then we started university, my girlfriend had random sadness and anger issues and she always said things that made me so upset, that I had to turn my phone off to not think about that.... Well, once I went at my university course (it was like 3 day stay at school, sports, dance and etc.) and I just had to turn off my phone again... I was so upset and went to have dance with my friends (it was better than sitting somewhere alone and sad.) I am not party guy but if I do party with my friends, I can do all the crazy dances and etc… and then I ended up on slow dance with girl (there was nothing wrong with it, we were just chatting and got dancing together just by accident... BUT there was a spark between us, like huge spark and we actually spend rest of the night smiling at each other and talking (but still, just as friends, no flirting and anything like that), it was nice but I was sure I want to stay with my gf.... But that spark never left me (and never left her)... She knows I am in relationship and when I tried to turn her down, she said she really likes who I am, my personality and she is going to wait. She is the kindest person I know and even thou she is not the sharpest one ( but honestly, I am also not the sharpest too), she is super hard working (I can brain out lot of things without much effort, but she can learn anything she wants (she has a strong will))  
   
 

3 Months later, me and my gf had really hard time understanding each other, we broke up and I just started to talk to THAT girl again and bought her flower just to make her happy (there was no date but it was still d\*ck move in my mind). Well one month after breakup my exgf wrote me, we started chatting and I decided I want to try that relationship again, because of that awesome summer. We are still together, I doesn’t work perfectly, especially while we are chatting (I am quite a busy person, I have my work as IT specialist and also I do tech help, web development, develop my own arduino solutions and repair/build laptops/PCs, graphics stuff and etc. so chatting is must and we were together for ""only"" about 20 hours a week).

Would it be creepy to send follow request to a guy after a month of no contact and no mutuals?,So I’m from a country where dating or talking to guys openly is considered a bit of a taboo. Few months ago I joined a gym near my apartment complex. There’s this guy also from my apartment complex who I realised liked me at the gym. I also started liking him and finally last month he got the courage to speak to me. Due to work I had to stop going to the gym for a month and when I returned he had stopped coming to the gym too. I tried finding him on social media but he had deactivated his accounts. But last week I saw his account on Instagram under people you might know.  Would it be ok or would it be creepy to send him a follow request even though we have no mutuals and a month has passed since we talked that one time at the gym?

How did you break off your first long term relationship where there was a kid involved?,"My relationship has turned into this toxic waste dump of a time and emotion black hole...

What should my fifteen-minute morning exercise routine be?,"I have about fifteen minutes I can spend in the morning to exercise. I have five and ten pound weights, a pull-up bar attached to a door frame, and a yoga mat. I don't really want to spend money on anything else.

I can't do push-ups, due to an injury that screwed up my shoulders. I've not really noticed other issues except for when I'm doing butterflies or similar movements. (My sister's an occupational therapist and she thinks I screwed up the cartilage or joint in that direction.)

I do have an extra minute on each side, since I use a Quip toothbrush and I could do something while I brush my teeth.

To men who have ghosted...why did you do it?,"I’m a 24F. I got ghosted the other day and it got me thinking. I’ve used apps before to meet guys to hook up and nothing more and it’s obviously mutually agreed upon that it’s just a hook up. So to the guys who have ghosted someone after a hook up (aka blocked their number and blocked them on the app and any other social media), why did you do it? Why not just not y’all to them again if you don’t want to? Why go out of your way to block them? It’s happened to me a few times in the past as well as this most recent time. I have no emotional involvement with any of these guys, but it still makes me feel super shitty to see that I’ve been blocked like I did something wrong or said something wrong or that I’m ugly or not good enough. And you don’t need to say “it’s probably because you suck in bed” cause I know that’s not it. I really don’t mean to sound cocky (for lack of better word), but I know that’s not the problem.

Do testicles have taste receptors?,"So recently, I’ve been seeing videos on tik tok of guys dipping their balls in soy sauce or sugar water, because supposedly testicles have have taste receptors. The tik toks have lots of mixed answers, some say they taste it, some don’t. 

So of course (without doing any research about this) I HAD to try it for myself. I just cut a plastic cup in half and filled about a quarter of it with soy sauce. I plopped my balls right in annnnnnd...nothing. I let my boys sit for about another 30 seconds; and still nothing.

What are some ideas of pictures or videos I can take to send to the wife?,"We took some time apart and are getting heated for each other. We're only 30 years old. So we are sort of discovering which kinks we might be into. Role play stuff and stuff. 

But when we're apart weve been taking pictures and sexting and I'm out of ideas of what I could do to send to her. The only thing I can think of is dick pics and masturbation. While she is super creative and sexy and could probably be in all kind of positions that are super dope I keep coming to a blank on what I could do in return other than masturbation and a simple dick pic.

At what age did you think of being committed to a serious relationship?,"A year recently, I have seen a guy quite often. We used to study the same university at undergraduate level some 10 years ago, graduating and working in different cities for some years after graduation.

Several years later, we happened to pursue graduate school abroad at the same country. He actually started 1 year earlier than me. As we have more time here meeting each other and we don't have many friends here, we are getting closer. We go to the supermarket, department stores, cook, go to the exhibition. We have a lot of things to talk and quite comfortable with asking each other out for a meeting.

If there is a guy friend who has feelings  but I don’t .... but flirt occasionally anyways. . What kind of response are you supposed to give?

So we matched on a dating sight and had been texting back and forth a lot but it was over the holidays and I was away visiting my family so we hadn’t physically met up. Things got heated we started sexting. But out conversation were great and sweet every morning I’d wake up to a text from him and go to bed with one.

How do I get over the formality hump in pursuing a relationship?,"The title might be a bit confusing, but the question I have is this. I don't have any problem talking to anyone once a conversation is started. As long as I have stuff to add to the conversation, talking is not a problem. The problem is I don't know how to veer things towards a more intimate tone. Not only that but I'm scared to even try, especially with people that I only kinda know or just met. 

In other words, when it comes to conversing with people about anything I don't have a problem, but the moment I think I want to pursue something with someone I hit a massive wall, and just have no idea where to start or what to say. 

I suppose some background, I'm 21 going to university, and my last and only relationship was at the end of freshman year of high school.

do men find tears/crying very alarming?,"So I've always been an emotional woman since I was a child (my parents didn't have the greatest relationship) and I'm the type of person to internalize my stress in order to not let it interfere with my work. I tend to cry and listen to music as a way of releasing my stress and negative emotions, because I feel infinitely better afterwards (I suppose it's like a coping mechanism). it's similar to how some people watch sad or dramatic movies (e.g. the notebook or me before you) to release &amp; forget about stress. 

my bf of about 9 months (and 3 years as a friend) is concerned about my crying habits. he thinks that I am depressed and he is also worried that he's a bad boyfriend that can't stop his gf from crying. I have told him countless times that I'm not crying because of him nor am I depressed, but rather it's a way for me to release stress (just like how he plays video games and takes naps). I've also told him that for me, I need to cry before facing stressful situations because then I can release my negative emotions and gain a clearer, more logical attitude towards the problem at hand. Also, I have been crying less lately because I've been finding other active ways to release my stress such as reading, yoga, and going out with my close girl friends.

but he still thinks that I am depressed &amp; that he is a bad boyfriend. of course, his concern is understandable and I appreciate the fact that he cares. but I want him to understand that my tears are not an indicator of sadness or depression, but rather a way for me to relieve my stress and emotions at the end of a tough day.

"Why is sex an essential part of love, an expression of it, yet sex alone can’t get you love?","
I apologize in advance if I make this too much about my biased experiences. 

I’m a 20 year old runway and lingerie model living in New York. I’ve been fully immersed in the adult world since I was 16 and have heard a lot of tales about marriages that break up due to lack of sex, or how sexual attraction is the foundation of any romantic relationship. 

When I turned 18 I started escorting through my agency to supplement my income and saw first hand all that men ( and some women) would put on the line ( thousands of dollars a night, their careers and reputations) to get some sex. 

I’ve slept with many individuals and couples who have immense power but would make themselves vulnerable for sex. These are people who are known to be cruel and hardened but they would become sweet during sex. 

I’ve fallen for a lot of my clients, in particular a couple that say that they’d do anything for me. I spend all my time giving them the most mind blowing sex, making all their wild fantasies come true. And they’d even tell me they loved me and say they would give up their empire for some mind blowing sex.

But when I was in a really desperate emotional situation, even when I still gave great sex they would change the subject when I looked for support. When I ask for them to listen, they might do so for a few seconds but then they want the clothes to come off again. Yet they can hold me like I’m their ultimate valentine after they orgasm and say they love me.

I realize they don’t love me. Yet the absence of the sex I give them causes men and women to leave long marriages. It just doesn’t make sense. I’ve seen men and women share the most intimate acts with me and then when they think I’m out of earshot they talk about me like I’m just another person they happened to know. 

I don’t know why they would call sex making love anymore. Love is such a valuable thing yet people treat sex like the most important and most trivial thing ever.",AskMen,"Why is sex an essential part of love, an expression of it, yet sex alone can’t get you love?

When I ask for them to listen, they might do so for a few seconds but then they want the clothes to come off again. Yet they can hold me like I’m their ultimate valentine after they orgasm and say they love me.

I realize they don’t love me. Yet the absence of the sex I give them causes men and women to leave long marriages. It just doesn’t make sense. I’ve seen men and women share the most intimate acts with me and then when they think I’m out of earshot they talk about me like I’m just another person they happened to know. 

I don’t know why they would call sex making love anymore. Love is such a valuable thing yet people treat sex like the most important and most trivial thing ever."

How to deal with a dude in our workout group that is constantly talking shit about me?,"so i workout with a group of people. this one dude is 6’2, 330lbs. to be brutally honest, he is fat and out of shape. yet he swears to god he is “super swole”, the “strongest in the gym”, he’s a “absolute unit” (he says all that stuff). im 5’8, 160lbs, around 12% body fat. him and i almost lift the same weight. He lifts like 10-15lbs more than me. he “can lift heavier but isn’t feeling it today” (his own words). 

he always makes subtle comments about me being “little” and “weak”. like today one of the guys in the group was squatting just over 500lbs and the dude i’m talking about goes “our whole group could probably squat that, well except [my name] he’s just too small and weak for that”. yet he squats the same weight as me. he will try to talk to a girl at the gym by pointing at me and saying “yeah you probably lift more than him”. Like we could be talking about lifting and out of no where he will throw my name in there and try to shit on me even though it was completely irrelevant to the conversation. 

i got on the scale and it was 161lbs, and he goes “dude you are so small. how are you only 160”. one of the other guys was like “dude, do you only work out with him so you can shit on him and feel better about yourself?”. 

at first i would just laugh it off and just put it aside as him joking around. But this is every day now and it’s just getting old.

"Why is long distance worth it, when is it the right time?","I already asked a question over on r/LongDistance, but I came here to see what you guys think.

TLDR: I just got into a new LDR with my girlfriend under the impression that our end date was sometime within a year. Over the phone, she told me that she was thinking about staying out of state for another 4 years. I want her to do whatever she wants and whatever makes her happy, but I don't know if I have it in me to do an LDR for 4 years.

Long Explanation: I am about 5 days into a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend of about 2 weeks. Now that I am saying that out loud it sounds kinda crazy, but let me explain.

I recently ended things with my ex-girlfriend (we will call her Mary \[19F\]), we had been talking for about 5-6 months and had been officially dating for about 2-3 months. We ended up breaking up because I realized I had just kind of fallen out of love with her, I was no longer happy with the relationship. Around that same time, my ex-ex girlfriend (we will call her Jane \[18F\]) just got back in town for Thanksgiving break from college. We ended up hanging out and the first night we just caught up. But then Jane and I were basically talking throughout the whole entire day and we ended up hanging out almost every night during the break (abt 7 days until she went back). Over the course of the rest of the semester, we facetimed/texted all of the time, and when she got back from Winter break we of course continued to spend a ton of time together.

Jane (explained): Jane is my ex-girlfriend (turned new girlfriend) that I dated for 6 months back in my senior year of high school, she was a junior at the time. Jane was my first real girlfriend that I truly loved and cared about and it was an amazing 6 months. But things started to change during the end of it and I could feel myself slipping out of the relationship. I ended up cheating on Jane with another girl (not sex though) and that was what ended our relationship. I honestly felt so horrible about it and mad at myself (I was also drunk when it happened), that I told Jill that I really felt like we should spend some time apart. I decided on this because for a while we tried to make it work, but she couldn't hang out with me without feeling like shit. So, in the end, we broke up.

Fast forward to this last semester, when I started dating Mary. She was amazing, and the first couple months were awesome. But then with a combination of things, I started to fall out of the relationship with Mary. We ended up breaking up around Thanksgiving break, where Jane comes back into the picture.

When Jane and I first started dating again, it was about 2 weeks ago and I was under the impression that she was going to come back to our home state within a semester to at most a year. We were talking a couple of days ago and she brought up the fact that she is thinking about doing 4 years of school out of state. As much as I love her, I just don't know if I have the capacity to do an LDR for another 4 years. Hell, I am only 5 days in and I miss her so much, it is probably one of the hardest things that I have ever had to do. So I brought up my thoughts and how I was feeling with her, and she thought that I was being selfish. Her reasoning was that I tell her all the time about how I would do anything for her, but that I wouldn't be able to do an LDR with her for longer than a semester. I told her I am open to the idea of a longer LDR, but that I just wasn't expecting it at the time. Luckily she is only a 6.5-hour drive away from me, but our schedules work out where we would only be able to see each other 1-2 times a month and I would be the one driving to the other person the majority of the time (she doesn't have a car). She asked me why can't we just take it one step at a time? I told her I think it would be a good idea to have an end date in mind.

How can I overcome the fear of being a lone wolf? (19m),"Although I’m an adult there are times where I hate being alone. I live in a pretty rough city and there are times where I ask my little brother to go places with me so I’m not a target. This is because our city can always have a shooting or a robbery at just about any time of day. I don’t think I have any enemies but I do know that I am always cautious. It honestly gets to the point to where I feel like a beta male. I do not participate in anything illegal or in gangs.  This instance also follows me to college at a stronger level since I go to school in a different  city. 

I don’t have an issue with being out alone. I think the bigger issue is always feeling like someone around me intends to try and rob or even kill me.

The Thing that surprises me is that this issue never even occurs to me when I’m with a girl.

I can't tell if he likes me," I've started this math class at my college that I go to once a week. I was late my first day so the only seat available was next to this cute guy. During that class we like joked around, but it was nothing that really caught my attention. So when it finished I walked out and got in my car to go home. Once I got on the freeway home I was in the fast lane behind a car that was driving slow. Mind you, it is 8 pm and there aren't many cars on the road right now. So I move over to try and pass, but as I speed up, the other car speeds up and won't let me pass. Of course i'm annoyed so I look over and see the guy from my class looking over and like laughing at me. We are both going the same way, he lives 20 from my house. So we like ""raced"" and he drove right next to me until I had to take my exit. So as next week comes along, I was joking around and told him he was driving so slow, and he was like ""I was slowing down because I thought it was funny."" During that class we both tease each other quite a bit, but like I'm so bad at knowing if he's really into me. He's a little shy with me but he like shows off and is more outspoken to the other guy in my group. I wish he would just ask for my snapchat or literally make a move.

When you see a woman like me, do you see it as ""she's great looking for someone who has such a small chest""? Like it's some kind of flaw? How do men really feel about really tiny boobs? 

Thank you kindly.",AskMen,"How do you feel about women with nearly flat chests?I'm a really cute woman (so I've been told) with a very small chest.

How often should you text a guy first?,"She's 24 and the guy she likes is 20. He said that he gets nervous when he talks to her and also told her that he is not currently seeing anyone else while they were hanging out. However, he is not good at texting , and she wonders if she should start messaging him first. He usually texts first but his responses tend to be one or two words. She worries that this shows a lack of interest but it could just be his nerves.

A beautiful girl I’ve been dating just disclosed she has HSV1 and that she most likely has it genitally. How big of a deal is this?,"**So, full disclaimer, we never had sex.**

Okay, I’m a 29[M] who went on 5 dates over the course of the last 4 weeks with a 25[F]. 

Everything was amazing at first. She’s beautiful, incredibly witty and intelligent, and is passionate about the work she does. Our dates all lasted 3+ hours and would end in heavy make out sessions in my car.

Everything was perfect until last night. We were  in my car and she was acting a little off and and said to me “ Have you ever gotten a cold sore? I have the cold sore virus, hsv1, but I most likely have it genitally. I had symptoms 3 years ago that swabbed negative but the doctors said they were fairly sure it was herpetic. All I know for sure is that I test positive on a blood test for hsv1 and negative for hsv2. I haven’t had anything pop up since and I’m not taking medicine but I could if you wanted me to...” yada yada yada...


At first I was in shock and didn’t know what to say, I wasn’t thinking and told her that it changed nothing. 

BUT all day I’ve been ruminating about this and I’m not sure what to do! I’ve never considered dating someone with an STD before. Have any of you guys been in this situation?

Do men usually prefer skinny girls? Why?,"It genuinely interests me. Do guys really like skinny girls? By skinny, I mean that you can feel pointy bones when you hold them. Super flat stomach and skinny arms and legs.
I understand that it depends on preference, but I want to know what the majority thinks.

What do you do when a girl cancels a date last minute?,"So had a great first date with a girl earlier this week. We kissed goodnight and made plans for last night. I was supposed to pick her up after work yesterday and about 30 min before I was about to leave she texts ""hey"". I assumed something was up then 10 min later she calls me and says she hasn't been feeling well all day and she wouldn't be much fun to hang out with and asked to do something on Tuesday, when I get home from my trip. I agreed and then she even asked how my day was, which I was surprised at. I asked her what she wants to do for Tuesday and she suggested she cooks us dinner then we watch a movie.

I was pretty bummed because I was looking forward to the date and last minute cancelled dates in the past for me haven't had a great track record for a makeup date.

So does it seem like she's not interested or am I getting worried over nothing? I like this girl and see her as gf material.

How do I save myself?,"At 18 I suffered a life-threatening injury that rendered me unable to attend college.  Suffering an ""Anoxic Brain Injury and Cardiac Arrest"", my confidence, self-esteem, mood and many other aspects of life I worked so hard to build seemingly plummeted after this single event.  I spent a long time solely recovering from my injury with the one goal of returning to school.  I'm currently 24, back in college and there are many aspects of my life I could complain about but I really just want to feel capable again.

That was what I felt at the core of my being prior to my injury.  A semi-sold foundation that was built upon my experiences with friends, girls, PE class, swimming, socializing and other things.  When I woke up, I was ready to face this life we all live in.  I knew not everything would go my way or even as planned but that's how it was.

Since I woke up from my comatose state and been conscious, I don't feel like a man or even that I'm growing/improving.  Rather I feel like a boy.  I've retracted into my shell/shy-nature that I broke out of in high school and I don't know what to reverse this.  I'm timid, quiet and scared.  Somewhere along the way I rediscovered my love for anime and video games and can literally shut myself in my room for the next decade.

What I'm asking is how do I save myself from a life of mediocrity or maybe even less than that with where I'm headed?  I'm currently travelling and visiting my father.  I live with my single mother, 2 brothers and am an uncle to one of my brother's two children.  I've spoken with my father and he describes that I am yet to cut my umbilical cord to my mother.  I love my mother to death but believe his vague statement is wrong as many things happened after my injury which resulted in me living a quite solitary and boring lifestyle.

But honestly, I'm just feeling like I'm sick of being a 'little bitch', for lack of a better word. For anyone here who used to lack confidence, drive or self-confidence, how did you find it? What did you do to fix the way you think and get what you want out of life?"

"Late-bloomers or virgins, how do you handle conversations about sex in your friends group?","First of all, I think this might have been asked before but the searches I made retrived me nothing.

I'm 27 and for reasons that mainly concern to my mental health (mostly anxiety, self-image issues) I'm a virgin. Sometimes I'm with my friends and they start to talk about sex, not in a bragging way, but mostly sharing and discussing opinions about it. This makes me insanely depressed. I believe they know I never had it, so I think they don't push me to talk about it, but still it's really bad to stand there and not participating and no really knowing what t do.  
In one hand I don't think they should stop talking about it just because of me, it would be selfish of me to ask them to do so and since it's not done in a harmful way, I don't think they do it in a harmful way. On the other hand I don't know how to react.

How to make lasting male friendships in your late twenties,"TLDR: 28 male who has struggled to make lasting friendships seeks advice on how to make and hold friendships, and what exactly you should expect from a good male to male friendship 

I’m 28 and am in a bit of a social rut.

I’ve been sick for about two years, and while I have made some friends during that time, I’ve had a hard time extending those friendships beyond the contexts that I meet them in.

I do have one good mate, but he lives far away and we only catch up about twice a month, sometimes it can be a couple of months before we see each other. I have another good friend from childhood, but he lives in a different city so we don’t speak much. We play phone tag a lot. 

I have a girlfriend who is great, but I need more male friends. I’m not socially bereft, but I am lonely sometimes and would like to make some more meaningful friendships with guys my own age.

I tried mini war gaming through a local hobby store and met some guys through that. Some are cool, some are just weird. It’s hit and miss when I bump into them because the store isn’t near where I live. I’ve been thinking about potentially trying another store as well just for variety - but truthfully I’m just nowhere near as into it as they are. And they don’t seem to have a lot of interests beyond it really. They’ll be sitting there geeking out about rules and stats, but I’m mostly interested in painting them. And I’m a slow painter and don’t spend as much on the hobby as they do. 

I want to get back into BJJ or maybe Muay Thai, but I’m to broke to afford that and a gym membership right now. The gym membership is cheaper, but the customer base there is older and I haven’t met anyone through there. I’ve also gained about 40kg from 2 years of quite bad physical health. While I am working out regulalry (3-5 a week depending), I’m struggling to regulate calories and that’s why I’m not losing weight. 

I am still in university. 6 years in to a three year degree (thanks, undiagnosed ADHD). I have made friends in different courses before, but they tend to fizzle our after the course is over. I make an effort to extend the friendships outside by organising times to get lunch, but it’s always me who does the organising I’ve found. None of them have lasted more than six months or so.

In all honesty, it’s so much easier to meet and sleep with women than it is to make friendships with men. That’s been my experience anyway. Maybe it’s just the kind of personality I have. 

I think as well I can inadvertently be too keen. ADHD does make you enthusiastic and curious, and sometimes I think I can be a bit much. I think I can make people feel like they’re being interviewed. I don’t mean to do it, I just don’t know how else I’m supposed to go about figuring them out. An older friend with ADHD has told me that often people with adhd just move to quickly for others, I guess that may be what happens.

I’m not socially retarded anymore. I definitely was when I was younger, but I can be quite popular in my work circles (depending on the place I worked at). The place I work at now is populated by older people who are dull. I’m interviewing for another role now, so hopefully that’ll put me back around other people my age.

I’ve always struggled to make an maintain friendships though. I’m really good at meeting people, just not at extending the friendships. I don’t really get invited to parties anymore (I don’t know anyone who hosts them to be fair). I used to really be into weed and ecstasy. I don’t do either anymore because they make me more anxious than I like to be. Sometimes it can be hard to find people who I relate to because of that - they just aren’t that interesting to me. And then the ones who dp drugs who I find interesting make me anxious because I don’t like to do drugs anymore. It’s tricky. 

I also just plain struggle to trust people. My best friend from high school turned out to be a massive narcissist and fucked with my head a lot. Another friend of mine who was older manipulated me and fucked with my head - to the point where there were times I feared for my safety. I understand not everyone is bad, but my radar for bad people may be a bit over zealous. 

Friendships with women are more what I’ve had. Emotional turn taking, lots of talking and back and forth. More just hanging out. As I got older I realised that in most cases, I was actually wanting to sleep with that girl and not being honest about it. Now I do have the good friendships with women, but they’re sexual relAtionships 90% of the time. I am currently in a monogamous relationship.

I’m bringing that up because...well I don’t really understand how to have ongoing friendships with men. It seems to be about activities. It’s not just about hanging out and talking shit. Drugs seem to be a big factor (even if we’re just talking about booze). 

The guys who I am closer friends with are super open. They are the ones who I have long talks with and who I just hang out and eat a good meal with. I don’t find many dudes who are like that though. Maybe I need to look for a different kind of friendship with men?

When to have the DTR talk?,"I'm 23 and he is 38,

I noticed he is very affectionate and warm, he kisses me, he holds my hand, hugs me, he is caring and smart, we only text to plan our dates besides that he doesn't text to catch up (I guess he is not a great texter), he is kinda mysterious, I don't know and I can't tell what does he is looking for I know the only way to find out is to ask him but I am very shy, introverted, insecure and I am scared to be rejected, I noticed he still uses his dating profile (even updated it with a new picture), I have the feeling he goes on dates with other girls and I  feel it's too soon to have the DTR talk (it has been 3 weeks since our first date), I am getting to know him more and I just don't want to crash, I need to find out what does he is looking for without scare him.

How do I stop thinking female interaction is them showing romantic interest in me?,"I'm not really sure how to approach this but I'll try to explain my perspective. I started a new internship last week and it's a big change from my previous experience, much larger group, more diverse, highly competitive, and a lot more interaction with female coworkers. Today I go in a bit earlier than usual and start working, around 9 the rest of the interns show up except for one, this chick shows up a bit late and sits next to me since no other seats are available.

Throughout the day she starts asking me a bunch of work-related questions, occasionally she does this thing where she looks in my direction says something softly as if she's expecting a response but she's not, and she does this weird thing where she looks at me as if she wants to say something but she doesn't say anything. I don't think this is anything, but while I was thinking about the ""signals"" I realized I do this a lot with the females I interact with where I interpret a regular conversation as flirting or some sort of interest in me.

Later in the day me and my brother were just hanging out and talking shit and this came up in conversation and he jokingly compared me to Joe from the Netflix show [You](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211991), I thought it was funny but I also think there was some truth in what he said, the tendency to over examine social interactions is unhealthy.

Men who had a decent/good/great relationship with their dad. What story do you want to tell about them?,"I dont remember how old i was but i was young.  My dad had an open water kayak.  We would spend most summer weekends paddling up and down the local lake.  He would sit in the seat and i would sit in the slot behind him, back to back.

We would stop off at some persons dock and diving board.  Never knew who the owners were.  

We fished in the reeds, telling stupid fart jokes.

We were in a cove, i was casting into the reeds.  And i snagged a decent fish.  My dad yelling at me to reel it in.  Me struggling to do so.  

I finally got that fish a few feet from the kayak.  I was leaning over trying to pull in, what was probably a 5lb fish.  My dad leans out with the net.

And ass over tea kettle goes the kayak.  When we both surfaced next to an overturned kayak.

"Men that are married or in a LTR, what is a funny/ weird/ awkward experience happened to you as a result of living with a woman long term, that would never happen to a single man, or male roommates?","I’ve been with my wife for nearly 15 years now, and one thing that constantly gives me a new “WTH?” moment is the places I find her hair. SWMBO has long (mid back length) very fine blonde hair. I’ve found her hair woven into the seam stitching of my work truck which she has never driven, and only ridden in a handful of times. I’ve gotten them wound between my toes because they’ve gotten into my socks and over the work day tied themselves around my toes. I’ve pulled them out of every piece of clothing I own at one point or another. I’ve even had one wrap itself around a tooth like a piece of floss somehow. Pulled them out of the dogs (both ends) and the cat. 
But today, a new and surprising hair discovery happened. About halfway through my day, I started to feel a strange and mildly uncomfortable sensation around my boys, plums, wedding tackle, nuts, balls, testicles, or whatever refer to them as. When I first noticed it, it just felt strange. So I manually adjusted, and the tightening feeling got stronger. At that point I just reached into my boxers to try and locate the cause of my “discomfort”. 

Turns out a couple of my wife’s sheddings had knotted into a literal clove hitch (ok, it might have been a bowline or anchor hitch, I was more concerned with removing the offending hairs than examining the knot work) around my sac that was tightening itself as I moved. I broke the constrictors with little force, but I just had [this reaction ](https://i.imgur.com/c2XimCY.gifv) for the next while. 

That’s a lot of words for a story about my balls. I’m sure I’ll think of other relevant female caused stuff that’s happened over the years, but his just happened today and I’m still kinda shocked.

Advice on mental health,"I don't know where to post this. I posted something similar on [r/selfhelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/) but didn't get any responses, so I hope this is the right place.

So this is something I can't quite get over. The mainstay advice if you're unattractive is to basically get in shape and become physically fit. I've been going to the gym for 2 years, have made okay progress but honestly am not where I should be. Because I'm not at my potential looks-wise, I feel worthless about who I currently am. I don't want to be happy until I've reached my full potential and this is causing a lot of anguish. When I look at gym transformation pictures, I don't feel motivated to change myself. Instead I feel bitter and resentful about how much better my life would be if I looked good and feel pity for my current meek self. There is no logic to these feelings. Of course it would be better to be strong and have muscles than to not, but to me this is synonymous with the paradigm that until I've reached that goal, I basically suck and am worthless. I just can't stand the thought of people in the future liking me because I've reached (lets face it) an evolutionary standard of male attractiveness, whereas before that I was a loser worth no ones time.

Has anybody else dealt with this? I want to change for the better, but I also don't want the journey to be painful. I could really use an eye opener right now, or some book recommendations/general advice.

Any advice is more than welcome, I just want to know how to get people to talk to me and spark up random conversations, (first, instead of me having to initiate the conversations for most of the occurrences), to be able to be good at (meaningful) conversations during which I could implement humour as well and lastly, to know how to approach more people.

Found a paper towel with brown crusty stuff. Is there a reasonable explanation for a private time pleasure moment to look like this?,"Long story short, my husband (24) has previously cheated, so I am extra observant. I know about self pleasure, I find the paper towel all the time (all clear crusty, sometimes slight yellow tint) 

I found a recent piece (I know it was found within 1-6 hours of the deed). The paper towel I found was with the crusty stuff (I know what it is). This time it had a brown tint in places. It looks as if it was wiped across skin to get the rest of it. It looks like what it looks like if there is slightly dried /old blood from a woman, mixed with the pleasure fluids. Am I making enough sense? 

Anyway, men, is there a reasonable explanation for this other than an extra marital relation? 

Please enlighten me, even if it’s the worst possible thought running through my head. 

Do I ask him about it? If it’s a normal think that happens sometimes, I feel it’s humiliating to show him, but if that’s not likely, maybe I grow a pair and ask him what’s up?

Tips on how to improve self-image/self-confidence,"This is probably a common question but wanted to ask anyways.

I (20yr M) have started to be called out by some close friends for not loving myself and think that I have no choice but to address it. 

Despite being told that I’m a decent looking guy at worst, I’ve had issues with confidence and body image for years. My first girlfriend made comments about my...anatomy that left me shamed, and since that point I have been scared to be intimate with anyone else. Discovering porn around that same time didn’t help and made me even more scared bc of the stereotype around black guys, which i don’t fit into. On top of this, I was bullied most of schooling until I started to play sports in high school. Even after the tide started turning on how others saw me, I have never been able to get the hurtful comments of that girlfriend and all the a-hole kids in primary school out of my head, and it still affects me to this day.

I already work out pretty regularly, am funny, and generally personable. Outside of my physical appearance, I am happy with myself and confident. But I can’t bring myself to like who I see in the mirror, and can’t even take a compliment.

"When can a girl act ""too much like a guy?""","My male to female friend ratio is about 3 to 1. I've always gotten along more with boys (and men, for that matter) than women and girls. I always chalked it up to the fact I have more in common with ""stereotypical boy"" things: Cars, Video Games (I have an entire collection of consoles and games), Porn, Money... etc. In translation I just levitated towards these things growing up and currently. Make up and nails don't interest me either, I only wear makeup for special occasions and such. I'm also significantly less emotional than most women that even my therapist picked up on it and so have my male friends, and I think logically and often have the level head in the group when everyone else is panicking or arguing. 

However, I'm also starting to wonder if these traits are also my downfall. 

Now, I'm not about rant about anything I really just want some male advice because I'm not a guy, but I have noticed that although all of my male friends have easily became my friend and latched on to me I started learning that they initially had crushes on me. It makes sense, but then as I talk to them and started asking why they never said anything I get the weirdest answers. One of my friends said that they thought they didn't have a chance and I'd be angry at them, another said that I didn't look interested in really anybody, therefore he would be wasting his breath, another said that I was more like a legitimate homie than an opportunity to date the more we got to know each other, and one said he friendzoned himself because ""we got along so well that he realized that he would have no one to argue with"" (This one got me). Other answers I've gotten are the typical ones, too scared, thought I'd stop being friends with them, etc. 

My 3 closest male friends, the ones I hang out with one on one, take me to dinner, get me gifts, tell me about their personal lives and I actually show affection to, that everyone said I should've dated, I haven't dated because of specific reasons: One is gay [18M] and I helped him figure out he was gay, One I've known since we were in the 4th grade [20M] and we're not each others type, and One is 7 years my senior [27M] and we know it would be short term because we have different goals. However I explained to them my issue I'm running into and they all said that there isn't anything wrong with me (literally, the [27M] said I was just too young). However the [18M] said I might be coming off more as a homie than a potential girlfriend and I should start acting more feminine. I thought he was crazy. I don't dress like a guy, and I clearly look like a female. Plus I was wondering if his version of female was the stereotype which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. 

I've also had a boyfriend, but I was acting completely different than I actually was so he would be be satisfied. Once I started showing who I truly was, from the fact I didn't want kids or settle down, cutting my hair, and my major was Economics- he was repulsed. We didn't last long after that, even though we dated for 4 years. I didn't know what was wrong with him, and I thought he just wanted someone submissive... but as I look around... it seems like these guys are kind of intimidated at me or I give off a wrong vibe. Am I really not feminine enough?

I also don't go out of my way to show interest, it's just not my style, I really just perfer you tell me if you are and I'll tell you how I feel and if it'll work or not. I'm not about to make a scene about it or anything... a proposal, sure... just asking me out on a date, no...

Is there any advice on this? I mean I don't plan on changing who I am for male attention at all, and I am only 19 so I have decades to actually find someone who actually fits me.

REALLY interested in what men have to say about this! please contribute ♡

scenario I: you and your domestic lady partner (gf, wife, w/e) share equal responsibility financially and domestically. you are supposed to do chore A daily (i.e. scoop ur cat’s litter box, your partner is allergic), and both partners are expected to clean up after themselves. you’ve consistently forgotten to do chore A, not because you don’t care and are lazy, only because you have a poor memory. so, nearly every other day your lady partner notices chore A hasn’t been done, and asks you to do it. in your ideal reality, how does she ask you? (answering: “she doesn’t.” is valid, if the bother is in being asked in the first place, i’m also interested in knowing that.) 

&gt; scenario Ib: everyday your lady partner asks you to put your dishes in the kitchen, clean up your spills / messes, pick up your socks, throw away your wrappers, cans, etc. you are expected, just as she is, to maintain a clean environment in the basic ways people do. you don’t keep up on your part, and throw your garbage on the ground, leave dishes to mold, knock things over and not pick them up, tear apart a cupboard searching for something and don’t put the things back or close the door, dirty laundry everywhere, etc. the two of you have discussed a tiring number of times the expectation, the importance, etc. you’re trying, you really are, for her at least, but you just fundamentally are messy. she doesn’t want to remind you, she doesn’t want to ask an adult man to clean up after himself, but she must, or it won’t happen. in your ideal reality, how does she ask you?

in both scenarios you’re being repeatedly asked to do something you’re expected to do anyway. is that nagging? is there a way to remind or ask that you’d prefer? is it different when it’s your father or male room mate?

&gt; scenario Ib: everyday your lady partner asks you to put your dishes in the kitchen, clean up your spills / messes, pick up your socks, throw away your wrappers, cans, etc. you are expected, just as she is, to maintain a clean environment in the basic ways people do. you don’t keep up on your part, and throw your garbage on the ground, leave dishes to mold, knock things over and not pick them up, tear apart a cupboard searching for something and don’t put the things back or close the door, dirty laundry everywhere, etc. the two of you have discussed a tiring number of times the expectation, the importance, etc. you’re trying, you really are, for her at least, but you just fundamentally are messy. she doesn’t want to remind you, she doesn’t want to ask an adult man to clean up after himself, but she must, or it won’t happen. in your ideal reality, how does she ask you? (“she doesn’t.” is still a valid answer.) 

——

in both scenarios you’re being repeatedly asked to do something you’re expected to do anyway. is that nagging? is there a way to remind or ask that you’d prefer? is it different when it’s your father or male room mate?

"Men of Reddit, what do you think about women who wear wigs or hair extensions?","I’m genuinely curious about what men, especially nonblack men, think about women who wear wigs. I know many women from all different backgrounds who wear wigs for different reasons, and a lot of them are open about it. Does it affect your attraction towards said woman? 

Just to clarify, I’m mixed with black and asian and ended up having thick course hair when I was young. Because of health reasons, my hair is thinning recently. I decided to chop it off very short and stick with natural looking wigs. Never really been open about it unless they ask. 

My ex girlfriend (who is white) loved my wigs. In fact, she would always suggest different colors and get excited whenever I came out with a new look. We broke up, so now I’m seeing a man this time (who is also white). He’s a Tinder date, but doesn’t know about my hair situation. 

I’m just curious if his attraction would deter. Many of my friends, girlfriends, boyfriends who were black - they didn’t mind. They saw it like an extension to beauty; similar to makeup, I guess. 

So what do you all think? And should I be upfront with my date?

How can I fix things with my girlfriend's parents when I've already messed up.,"Idk if this belongs here but i wasn't getting any help anywhere else.
So my gf and I have been dating for close to 4 months now. However at ab 2 months our parents found out. Her and I were not even sapossed to be talking but we did anyway. So her mom got mad, my mom got mad.
After that her and I started sending notes to one another. (We had a mutual friend who passed them) and that went in for I want to say a month and a half I think. But once again id even know how they found out but our parents found them. So again we got in trouble and we were forbidden to see eachother or talk to eachother.
So after that happened maybe a week after, I decided I needed to apolagize to her mother. We met at a coffee shop and I apolagized and told her I felt bad and I wanted to make this GS right so one day I could see her daughter again. She didn't really budge and said all this stuff ab how she didn't even want us to talk as friends even for maybe two years. 
I half excepted that and half didn't. I started to feel really bad because my girlfriend is going through all this alone by herself and she doesn't have anyone to talk to or ask for help with. And so  through that mutual friend I sent small verbal messages to my gf. Something like I love you so much and I miss you to death. Something small like that but also enough to keep her spirits up.

Well guys no idea how but, her mom found out. So she's in really big trouble I'm in really big trouble. Yesterday my grandpa sat me down (my dad isn't in the picture anymore) and talked to me ab the situation. He helped me understand the parents side of this and how I was wrong ( I didn't see how I was wrong before). But now I understand she's just trying to protect her daughter. I understand that I am in the wrong. I understand that it's her job as a parent. I understand that I was being really stupid before. And I was thinking I know better I'm smarter ik more. Like a dumb teenager. I want to make things right with her and her husband. I want to apolagize. And tell them that I'm sorry that they were right I want to talk to them and help them understand that I was just being a headstrong idiot.
But after the first time. I'm so scared  that she won't except my apolagy. I'm scared that she won't even want to talk. I'm scared maybe I've gone to far and maybe I'll never be able to see my Gf again when we are teens. Or lose her altogether. I love this girl more then anything with all my heart.

I'm about to lose my  house to help my father pay his debts(financial business losses which have left us without any savings).  My mother and father will be shifting away to our old native place. My sister will be in a hostel till she completed her studies, and I'll be without a house temporarily.

To top all of that, I asked out my best friend of a few years and got rejected. I had really strong feelings for her and I'm completely crushed rn.

People who have been in worse situations how can I bounce back from this. The only thing I have going is my job....

How to make that step from casual convo to flirting,"I basically missed out on high school partying and that so i never figured this out. I always thought i was ugly too but two separate women have called me cute so i finally have some confidence to put myself out there.

Im fine talking to women in a group but 1 on 1 i dont know how to really flirt or anything. Any advice you guys could give? I know trial and error is the only way but maybe tell me stuff that doesnt work so i can skip trying that.

Also how can you tell when a woman is attracted to you?",AskMen,"How to make that step from casual convo to flirtingI basically missed out on high school partying and that so i never figured this out.

My gf offered me her late brothers very expensive coat and I didn’t know how to respond to it.,"Her brother passed away not too long ago and she recently came back from bereavement. She brought back a few of his things that she plans to use herself. One of the items she brought Was one of his very expensive winter coat that fits her but she says fits too much like a guys jacket (obv) but she and her family don’t want to throw it away or sell it. 

She said I should wear it. I tried to push it off saying it won’t fit me but she had me try it on and it fit. I turned it down saying a woman wearing an oversized coat is “in” and she can pull it out occasionally. 

I am not sure if that was the right thing to do. Should I take it and store it for her since I know she’s also low on closet space. Should I take it and wear it to remind her of her bro? What’s the right move? I feel like I’m walking on eggshells but want to be there for her.

"17 M, should I be worried about my lack of female friends or acquaintances?","I’m gonna preface this by saying that I’m pretty self-confident, I know that I’m moderately attractive (at least not too ugly), I get a bit nervous around new people, but I’m very comfortable around people that I have gotten to know, and although I don’t have many close friends, I have been getting better at building those kinds of relationships. Obviously, my self-perception is biased, and probably not how everyone else sees me at all, so I might have some glaring faults that I can’t admit to myself that can be the main factor in this. 


I live in a world completely insulated from girls, a boys boarding school. Normally, this would give me some closure, it’s out of my control. However, more and more, I find that people in my year have girlfriends and vast networks of girl acquaintances. I know that I should be networking, to gain access to these circles, but honestly between my cowardice and the fact that friendship groups have been solidified to the point where I can only really be an acquaintance, I am finding it hard to meet girls the way they’re doing it. Now, I start uni next year, I’m sure that even I can find success in a coed environment, but who knows. I’m worried that this problem stems from beyond my environment, but something that’s inherently wrong with me. 

TLDR: how do I meet girls in an environment without any? And, if I fail, how should I improve to make sure that I can succeed in the future?

"Men, how do you mentally/emotionally prepare yourself for the day your ex moves out.","I broke up with my girlfriend of 1 year(lived together for 3months) two days ago.

It came to a point when she pretended to be mad at me for the sake of affection, and I genuinely thought she was mad. I then realised, I was afraid of her and that wasn’t healthy. But damn, when we weren’t fighting, we were the happiest and it was soooooo good.

To make it worse, my girlfriend did something that was completely her fault, on purpose, and it angered the hell out of me.

How can I gently persuade my partner to let go of material possessions?,"I've (28m) have lived with my partner (25f) for 4 years now. I love her to bits, but something ive noticed since day 1 is she owns alot of stuff. Before I met her I had travelled and moved around alot, I basically have never really owned much of anything. 

Anyway, 2 years ago we bought our first house. 3 bed 1 bath, we are the only people who live here. We've renovated it since we moved in and I've let her decorate the entire place, it's got a really boho- lots of indoor plants- sit on the rug and drink exotic tea sorta vibe. It looks fantastic, I love what shes done with the place, but every closet in every room is full of stuff, which naturally leaks into the living spaces. Every drawer, every cupboard is stacked full of stuff. It takes hours and hours to clean and organize because there is so much stuff. As a few examples, we have a closet full of painting equipment and blank canvases, like 50+ canvases in there, we paint maybe once per year. Theres a whole double closet full of fabrics, sewing machines, mannequins, and cosplay stuff I've never seen her use since we met. Probably 2 giant storage bins full of dairies, journals, planners, blank books etc but none have ever been used, she has 1 that she uses daily and the rest just sit there. Even stuff like bedding, we have 10 sets of sheets for our bed and 4 different quilt cover options, we only have 1 bed in the entire house, and probably 30 pairs of shoes, half of which have never been worn.

I've never made an issue of it, financially were pretty secure so I've never policed how she spends her money, it's her money. But in a practical sense we are running out of room in this house and i refuse to get a storage lockup, i feel a 3 bed house should be more than enough for 2 people? 

Every 3 months or so I go through my stuff and either donate or bin anything I dont need, she will do the same, but her donate pile is just a few things she really doesnt want. 

How can I help her declutter her life, or atleast make suggestions about letting a few things go to make our day to day lives easier and more practical? I used to ride motorcycles, but I cant see myself buying one anytime in the next 5 years so I sold all my riding gear, and I think this might be a fundamental difference in how we think. She holds on to her cosplay stuff incase she wants to make another outfit one day, despite not making one in 6 years. 

Another option I've considered is hiring a cleaner, which I'm not against if that's what the advice suggests but I've voiced this before and my partner didnt like the idea of someone else cleaning up our own mess and I kinda feel the same. I also dont think shes a hoarder, shes just a creative person who likes having her resources always available, even if they wont be used in the foreseeable future.

Banged a 4/10 while drunk and don't know how to feel about it,"Alright so here's the deal. I went to a frat party last night and got slammed.

She was dancing on me and things started escalating throughout the night and eventually she took me to one of the rooms in the house to go fuck. At that point, I was pretty damn recked already and wasn't really conscious of who I was fucking. Now, a day later I am reminiscing on yesterday's events and don't know how to feel about it. I texted her to make sure she was alright and she sounded like she wanted to go for some extra rounds.

How do you get a girl’s vagina smell off of your fingers? [NSFW],"Long story short, I met up with a really cute girl for a tinder date and we went back to her house. We watched a movie for a bit and then started getting intimate.

She asked what was wrong but I told her I usually don’t like to fuck on the first date and I felt as if we should wait a bit more. She bought it and I internally let out the biggest sigh of relief I ever have in my life.

"Men of Reddit, I need your advice to see if I was being dramatic or not.","So, let me get some groundwork out of the way:

I'm 22 y/o, I've been working at a factory for around 8 months. In this factory, my position is with a small group of co-workers (3-4 daily), most of these people have been with me from the start.  Outside of that, I'm part of a group of friends (but I'm really more like a ""third wheel"" if anything).

**Okay, here's how it starts:**

So, last week I was working at my job, and my ""then"" supervisor told me that I was lying about the position I worked at and that I needed to return to my field. So, turns out my records were messed up and it showed worked in a lower part of the job than I did. So listen, last month the factory asked me several times to do 'volunteer help' (i.e work in a different part of the factory outside of your usual) for the holidays, for about four weeks. It think what happened was that I volunteered there so many times atp, that they thought I worked there permanently. So, they changed my records.

After that happened, I obviously went to the front desk to sort the situation. They said they'll look at my history and take care of it. Cool. 

Next week passes, it's still not fixed. So my supervisor comes up and tells me why I'm here and I should be working at the other place. I tell her that I've always here and that they're fixing the situation right now. She tells me to provide proof (since my records weren't fixed, I couldn't), otherwise I would get in trouble for being off-task. I tell my co-workers to vouch for me since they've been with me since the start. They didn't say anything AT ALL, because again...no records, and they didn't want to get in trouble.

So, I spent the rest of the shift working in the wrong position and then spent next SIX hours trying to prove my case, otherwise I could lose my job. I quit my job yesterday and am already working at a different building (same business however).

So, essentially I felt I got punished for something that was completely their fault.

**AFTERWARDS:**

I drive home and I find out I'm out of gas, there's one gas station nearby and I don't have any change. I can't ask any of my family or friends for help, because they're broke too. I ask the people at the gas stalls for help, but they said no. I ask the people inside the store for help, but they kick me out. I call one of my close friends for help cause I know he's gets paid that day, but he didn't even respond. He does that every time I need help. So, I spend the next hour trying to find lose change (it was an open plain, no one cared) to exchange for gas money. I eventually find $1.80 worth of change, which is literally just enough to get to my house. So, I roll out.

FURTHERMORE:

So, I'm pissed about how my day went and I wanted to talk one of my friends about it. I call him and he says he's sleeping. I tell I'll call him later since he's sleeping and I won't bother him, and he angrily responds with 'what do you want?'

I explain to him my situation, involving leaving my job, and the stuff at the gas station. And he just says, ""is that all you called me for?"". ""What do you hope to accomplish?"" I respond by saying, ""I don't want to accomplish anything. I just want you to listen"". I ask him what's wrong with that and he says that he doesn't like that I called him just to chat and that I should only call him ""for important things"". Not just to see ""how my day was"". I tell him fine and to just go back to bed. He hangs up on me.

I lost my MIND after that. Flailing my arms, banging my head on the ground, shouting at the world. I went insane, because I felt like at that moment, NO ONE had my back.

What do you expect from a woman when having sex?,"I (20F) have been in a bunch of different relationships, but sleeping with someone new is always something difficult for me because I feel like a lot of pressure about ""being good in bed"". 

Here's a little bit of context for my question but you don't have to read that, you can just answer the question in general. 

I am now coming to the end of a two year fight with vaginislus, which used to prevent me from having any penetrative sex. This has not stopped me from having a thrilling and inventive sex life with my partners, but I always feel like what I am doing is not as good as it should be. For example, I like giving head but I can't (and don't want to) deepthroat. Or, whether it is a blowjob or handjob, even if the guy is enjoying himself I can't really tell if what he's feeling is kind of generic pleasure or something really good. And I know the easiest way to know is to ask but I find it also really un-sexy to do a debriefing everything that happens in bed everytime. Also I know I can now have sex with penetration but I also know it takes a lot of time for me to ""let it in"" because my muscle just need time to relax. And although I have been sexually active for 2/3 years now, penetration is new for me and I fear that I'm going to be ""boring"" to the next guy I have sex with because of all of that stuff....
I know that is quite a problem about my own confidence as well, but with one of my ex boyfriends, I felt like we had a great, inventive and thrilling  sex life and he always said he had no problem with me having vaginismus, that is was okay, but when we broke up he told me about how frustrated and unhappy I made him because of that illness. So I don't know what's true anymore haha.",AskMen,"What do you expect from a woman when having sex?I (20F) have been in a bunch of different relationships, but sleeping with someone new is always something difficult for me because I feel like a lot of pressure about ""being good in bed"".

How do you deal with extreme body envy?,"Hey all. This is a serious question, so if you answer, please be respectful. I also really hope this is an appropriate subreddit to ask this in.

I realize now just how awkward of a post this is, how taboo it is, etc. I don't believe myself to be homosexual. However, I have come to terms with myself on something: I have a problem with constantly looking at pictures of men that are in great shape, and are young. I myself am young, and in decent shape, but I covet those with muscular physiques. Not because I want have sex with them, but because I want to almost *be* them in, a sense. It's gotten out of control; starting with just thoughts of insecurity, losing focus at the gym when someone with a desirable size is nearby, masturbating to videos and images of muscle worship, and questioning if I have bigorexia or some kind of depression. I think I am attracted to the idea of being a better version of myself. Someone who is more successful, and the big-man in the room. And my biggest takeaway, is that I think this is severely hurting me in the dating field because I am so obsessive over myself, that I constantly am fighting the battle of: ""how can I love someone else if I don't love myself"".

Has anyone suffered from this, to this degree? Am I in a minority? Is this a mental health issue? I realize that yeah, sure, everyone wishes they looked a little better, and self-image is a challenge for men and women alike.

Can you really just be friends with a coworker?,"Me [27F] and my boyfriend [30M] have been dating for four years. 
Recently he bought a house that had a guest house attached so that we could turn it into an Airbnb and make a profit. Come to find out he asked one of his female (our age or younger)!coworkers that he has mentioned to me in conversation before but I never really paid any attention to it. He went shopping with her and lied to my face about it. He said he went alone. When the same night was my company work party and he didn’t come. Anyway. She kept shopping on various days without him and texting him and sending him pictures of things she liked and thought he should buy. He showed them to me and asked my opinion, that was when I started noticing her in our conversations more. 

Then I started to become suspicious after he lied to me about going shopping with her. I went through his phone. (I know, not proud). He had a random picture of her at a construction site (their job) eating alone with a sandwich on his phone(?)She is an instagram “influencer” and posts half naked pictures of herself and has thousands of followers, he started liking every one of her pictures. Then, she started a website where her followers pay her for content. He is subscribing for $5 a month. When asked about it he just stated that he is supporting his friend and all his coworkers are doing it and she is paying them back.

How do I become less annoying when I text people I’m sexually interested in?,"It’s a reoccurring issue for me. 

I find someone I’m interested in, I text them and am 99% of the time asking them questions first, I reply immediately or within 5 minutes if I’m not busy, and genuinely try to take an interest in them. I’m not one for longing out a conversation over a week. If I’m sexually attracted to someone and we both want to have sex (potentially), I don’t like waiting too long to meet after we’ve talked about ourselves for a bit. 

Whenever a conversation takes longer than 1.5 weeks and we’re still talking about general things about ourselves, I’m usually certain the conversation will never progress to meeting up in person. Most/all of my sexual conversations started out on some type of app. Of all the people I was sexually interested in, I’m talking to no one long term.

My brother is a victim of domestic abuse. What can I do?,"My brother is recently married too a woman who is not very nice at all. She's very unpleasant and argumentative as well as negative and derogatory towards pretty much everyone.

But thats not the worst of it and if it was I wouldn't be making this post.

She abuses my brother verbally and emotionally. She is constantly yelling at him and putting him down. When I say constantly I mean CONSTANTLY, she has no shame about it, she will yell in public, at the dinner table and in front of me, my mom and my sister.

But that is still not the worst. She financially abuses him as well. All of his paycheck goes directly to her and she only gives him a small allowance. She does this for her own gain, but also to control his actions as he is only allowed to spend what she let's him spend.

His spending money is virtually nothing and he often has to ask my mom to buy him things, like entrance fees when we go to do things, restaurants and on one occasion even clothes... All this from a man who has a full time job and makes €40k per year.

But what gets me the most is his attitude to it... He doesn't believe there is anything wrong.

My brother has had a troubled past. He has struggled with his career, with depression and with alcohol and he has very low self esteem. He says he doesn't care about her yelling because he does make mistakes and he doesn't care about the money because he doesn't know how to handle money himself.

But I know my brother. He is beaten down and is unhappy and afraid to express himself. He shakes like a cowering dog at the first sign of conflict... It is very disheartening to see that in your older brother.

Straight guys: What is the dating etiquette for informing a man about your period?,"Okay this sounds oddly specific, but since it’s a situation that me (f22) and my girlfriends frequently have been in and  discussed, I thought this might be the place to get some answers. 

The situation is as follows: you’re dating a guy in the casual way that seems so common nowadays,meaning that you started by hooking up. Now you’re doing it frequently. It has not yet been established if you’re headed towards more than sex, but sometimes you’ll do other things like watch a movie, cook some food, get a drink at your place etc. Sex always happens, but when you make plans, you do it to see each other and you always plan an activity. It’s not a “hey wanna hook up”- type of arrangement although you always end up in bed. Maybe you hope it will lead to something more. So what do you do, when you have a date planned and you’ll be on your period? 

Is there some kind of etiquette to whether you need to “warn” the guy beforehand that it is that time of the month, so he knows sex might not happen or there’ll be blood involved?
My friends and I always feel awkward bringing it up on text and especially if you like them, you don’t want to assume the sole purpose of the date is to hook up. We know not having sex is not the end of the world, but also don’t want the guy to show up expecting it and be disappointed.

Got myself into a bad situation at school and my future is potentially at risk. I don’t know what to do. Advice needed.,"Bit of context here, i’m 18 and i’m resitting my A-levels (UK) so I can get into university as I failed last time. 

So last monday I was in my chem class, now in my school we have this shitty system where if a student is misbehaving and a teacher is unwilling to let it continue, then they just send the kid into another teachers class. 

So this kid gets sent in (15-16) and walks to the back of the class and stares directly at me the entire way, at first I let it go but then it happened 2 more times and my ego got the best of me and I ask “what the fuck are you looking at?” It got a bit heated and my teacher sent him away and commended me on my restraint lol. 

Kid comes back later with about 10 of his boys and starts making a commotion outside the class shouting at me to step outside, obviously I’m not stupid enough to do that so I just let staff defuse the situation. 

Nothing really happened since until monday ( as in 2 days ago) when that same group of kids came to my chem class again tried to intimidate me, threatening me and such, at this point it was starting to get under my skin and they were beginning to get inside my head. Bear in mind I am resitting the year (Retaking the grade for you americans) meaning all of my friends are either in university or have jobs, so nobody has my back and I’m alone up against an entire social group. 

As i’m in sixth form we have our own common room so I’m safe there, but now when I have to go to classes I have to cross their yard to get their, so I have to deal with multiple people shouting shit to me and it is targeted and they ARE looking and waiting for me to do so. 

So yeah, i’m not gonna lie i’m fucking scared, I could end up getting jumped and theres practically nothing I can do to defend myself. I also deal with anxiety issues from time to time, i’ve had it under control for a while now but these events have put it into overdrive and now its on my mind constantly and i’m filled with a constant state of dread, I can’t even fight the guy because it would class as assaulting a minor. 

Realistically I have little to fear as i’m bigger, older and muscular, but I can’t shake it. These kids are the low income, broken home, nothing to lose kind who know they’re headed nowhere and I’ve always been intimidated by those sorts so that may factor into my fear a bit.

What acronyms/slang do you use the most in regular everyday life?,"Obviously, everyone says ""lol"". It's understood that ""r.a.d.a.r."" is an acronym people have used for many years.

However, I noticed that people outside the military speak in acronyms frequently enough that one could simply not be able to understand the conversation.

Is it ""on brand"" for you to watch football because you were once a football player while in school? Or is it actually ""off brand"" to cheer for a team you like for their colors?

How can I try to get over and change the fact that I fall for girls way too easily?,"I'm 17 and in the past few years I've had like 8 serious crushes. All it takes sometimes for me to fall for someone is to have one conversation with them. I hate it.

I really liked ome girl for ages since the start of 2019. But in september I told her how I felt and then over the past few months it 90% diffused. We're not pretty close friends.

Since then there have been a few that have come and gone but now I feel a major one coming again (lol that sounds funny). Theres a girl in my japanese class who I'm beginning to really like. Weve talked a little bit online the past few days and I'm feeling pretty similar to how I did with the last girl.

I hate it. As much as when things go well with her, it makes me really happy, the lows are awful. When I get into.states like this the girl almost just control the way i feel. I'll over analyse everything she says or is said about her, I'll be constantly e-stalking her, and I'll be obsessed over her. Like I said, I feel this coming on again.

What do you think I could do to change this? I really want to get out of this state because it's not healthy at all. It may sound silly but I'm currently trying nofap in a desperate attempt. I'm wondering if that will change stuff since it's obviously linked to romantic and sexual thoughts.

"How to deal with a ""distant"" friend?","First of all, english is not my first language, but here we go;

For some context, I met this girl in my class about a year-ish ago, and we got along really well, we thought the same way about a lot of stuff, we behaved somewhat similarly (pretty chill about everything, same humour, similar mindset..), but it always felt like after school finished, I was out of the picture of her life for the most part (never asked to hang out, even if I hinted that i'd be fine with it and even gave some ideas,  if I texted her most of the times she seemed somewhat annoyed (in the summer, she left a text unanswered for 2 months), and even said herself that she just doesn't like anything to do with texting/calls etc, and in general never really contacted me other than to ask class-related stuff...)

I attributed all of this to her just not openning up to me, since we never really spoke about really personal stuff, and maybe she just didn't really like to give a first step into a more ""private"" friendship, so about 4 months ago I decided to open up myself, in hopes to give her a free pass into my life, so she doesn't have any pressure in doing the same with me. This looked like somewhat of a success, since after it she started looking for me if we weren't together, started voluntaring herself into teaming up for casual  assignments, but still never really gave a fuck from the moment school was done.

Since the start, I really cared about her, reminded her of everything that had to be done, helped her with whatever she was struggling (everything that you do to somewhat that you consider a good friend), but I got pretty little back, which didn't feel good at all, and it's worse considering the amount of time I did it for, so after this christmas I kinda called it out, and decided to stop caring as much myself, so I don't feel like she has to ""return"" any favor to me anymore.

For the past 20 days, it has felt really good. I feel relieved and empowered by the fact that I did such a decision so confidently, executed it and actually worked out how I thought it would (first few days was kind of hard since im a pretty ""sweet and caring"" dude, but from there I got used to it pretty fast)

But today, after finishing school she has asked me if I have a problem in my personal life or with her, since I feel different, but I didn't give a clear answer since it would make everything awkward for the month\~\~ that I got left to finish my studies, but will for sure clear stuff up at the end so I don't leave any bad feelings on her.

So, was this the proper way of doing it? How to handle future people that behave the same way as her? I know for a fact that she very much enjoys the way she handles friendships, and loves her ""chill"" life with barely any contact with people, and I would never ask for more attention to a 22 year old that is not a really close friend, since I feel like it's just begging like a kid, and it's just annoying to deal with for the other person.

What's going on in your mind as you're making out with the girl and about to go for the boob?,"Are you nervous, excited, or thinking about Chipotle?",AskMen,"What's going on in your mind as you're making out with the girl and about to go for the boob?Are you nervous, excited, or thinking about Chipotle?"
What should i do with this girl. which option should i pick?,"Will try to keep it short.

So i met this girl at a festival in NYC last November, the first night was quick a couple of minutes ang got her insta. The second day Dmed and saw her again and we danced for hours but nothing really happened expect of a quick goodbye kiss. 

Dmed the next day and found out she is just visiting and got home (Louisiana). We kept texting and calling each other with no pressure at all. Like we would spend days without call/text and very normal for one of us to only text back the next day or so (very chill)

I knew that she was getting into me, stating how amazing i was and actually always initiating and wanting to call me and to not forget her. On my birthday (in December) she said as a gift she will buy a flight tix to ny and come visit me, which she did and came last weekend this January. 

To be honest, i wasn't really excited, I’m always active and have some many things going on (in a good way) that keeps me busy and not having the time to really think about those things and get my feelings attached (also don’t want to me, cause it breaks my rhythm like now lol).

Unfortunately, when she came, i did a lot of mistakes which aren't big deal but i'm not that stupid and i know that they would accumulate and especially from a girl's prospective they mean something.

1 Mistake - i called after work to meet her (i live in n=NJ) and we planned to meet in NJ then go together to NYC, but she already went there and need to come back to change for the night and i was like ""why didn't you wait, now we have to go twice, pay toll again but also it's crazy ass traffic in nyc at rush hour"", where i should have not think about those, i mean she came to visit and here I am pointing about things that make her sound not important to me. 

Anyways, i wait for her call to go to her place and pick her up. we went to the party (we were both rolling). everything was great, no details needed

2 Mistake- we got home to my place, which was already planned this way, so we can finish our little after-party. I am a Dj so first thing turned on the mixer and started playing. I believe the second mistake was not paying really attention to her and got into the music that i forget that i should probably put a set playing itself and lay down with her and just enjoy each other. After putting a last song playing for 15mins or so, we were kissing pretty intensely and meanwhile she called a lyft stating she has to do some stuff in the morning

3 Mistakes- she got a shooting the next day in Brooklyn and the plan was to join her, but it was snowing badly and pretty cold and i'm just going to see her getting pictures for two hours, so i said i meet afterwards. (which is probably another mistake making her sound like less important)

4 Mistakes- I text around 7pm checking if she got home, not yet. the plan, we; re going to my friend's place in nyc for his birthday. she said 9:30pm would be good. I asked please do me a favor and try to be ready around 9. She said just go and will catch me ( I should went to her place and sit there until she finishes, more time together). Her flight was at 9am tomorrow and she wanna pack before leaving. Texting her throughout the night keeping her update as my friends kept changing plans. 

We went to a bar and she ended up showing around 1:30am (she brought edible as a gift). the night was great, we danced and had a blast. I offered to drive her home, but she rejected and said no worries gotta go (around 3:30am). 

i realized i forgot some ecstasy at her place (which i think she did it on purpose, but who knows, not important detail), i texted her to come and once there, she asked if i'm alone, told her my friend waiting in the car ( but also can't stay, she has to go to the airport in about 2/3hours ( itwas 5am )) we got good kisses and some quick goodbyes.

The rest is through those texts:

Forgot to tell you, thanks for everything!

Me: Hahaha glad you’re finally home

And It was a pleasure for me seeing you here, i wanna thank YOU. Go rest and do you thing and call me if you get a chance tonight

**1/20/20, 6:43 AM**

Her :Omg! Fall asleep yesterday at 6:00 pm, woke up for 2 minutes, fall asleep again and just woke up again because I had a nightmare lol... can’t believe it. Anyways, hope you have a great day today. (:

Me: I can imagine, you had a pretty intense weekend, lacking so much sleep. Buenas Dias para tu and take good care of yourself 😘

No call been made this then and sent the voice message at 5:30pm which she heard and saved at 8pm that goes a bit like this:

“I literally wanna thank you for putting the effort and investing in visiting me. What you did is pretty crazy, done in a tight schedule, it was pretty much a hustle. If anyone does this to me, i would be speechless and don't really like being in this position where someone overdo something to me. I also wanted to take you to so many other places and .i think i didn't welcome you the right way, but at the same time i wanted to give you your space and let you feel free to do whatever suits best for you. I hope i'm not wrong, but i believe you're a great person inside out and if i see you again, i hope i will get the chance to give back to you even a little bit. Again, thank you so much Keep on smiling with that beautiful smile and take good care of yourself. muchos besos""

Since then she just saved the message (which means she heard it) and never replied back.

Before even sending the voice message i knew that i messed up with her and expected her not to reply back. If she was in NJ, i wouldn’t bother and try again but since she is in another state (I have nothing to lose), i said i'm gonna take this opportunity and learn from it, add it to my experience. Rather than not reaching out, i'm gonna do the opposite. I'm not expecting anything from her but wanna test for future occasion and learn

So redditers, here I am skiing for your help and sorry for this long post.

option1: just call, if no answers or no call back, that's it

option2: send a voice message saying: hey i know you're mad at me and i wanna say sorry, maybe state my mistakes, then say i'm gonna leave it here and if don't hear back from you, then that means that I should leave you on your own and wish all the best blah blah blah

option3: send a text instead which says the same thing as option3 (i prefer voice)

option 4: just send a text like nothing happened and say something like "" hey girl, how have you been, feeling recovered from nyc""

option 5: call, if no answer. leave a text (one of the option 2,3 or 4)

option 6: send her something funny on Instagram related to her somehow, like nothing happened 

option 7: text "" hey what's going on"" ask about the shooting how did it go and go from there maybe ask for a pic or so

option8: send a voice message saying whatever i want and goodbye for real like no more reaching out, a way to close things out in my mind and turn the page

How would you tell your friend they're terrible at telling a story?,"We've got a small group of close friends, myself and 3 other guys from grade school/college.

Me, D and J have all been friends since grade school and all throughout HS/college. Our newest friend, Z, we met freshman year in college. He's a great dude and has become a really good friend to all of us over time. The problem is he's the absolute worst person to listen too when he's telling a story.. I'm sure everyone has dealt with the type of person: always adding unnecessary details, gets side tracked super easily in the middle of a story and the worst part is they seem to go on forever and by the time he's done we've all lost interest.. 

Me, D and J have spoken about this privately but no one has the heart to tell Z. I don't know how he can't tell, we're obviously not rude about it but he has to be able to tell we don't have the same enthusiasm when he decides he wants to raddle off another 25 minute story that seemingly goes no where every time. 

I don't wanna be the asshole friend that has to tell him but someone needs to let him know so I'm wondering what's the most polite way I can go about doing this or how would you handle the situation if it were one of your friends?

To clarify, he said guy out probably because I saved him as guy in my messanger. And he put the weed in the grinder. Now to why I'm confused... We haven't had contact for 4 months or so. We stopped seeing each other because I realized that whole fwb thing wasn't for me and he didn't want a serious relationship after his ex destroyed him. But why sending me that package now?

Is this abusive? Having serious doubts about my relationship with my long term S.O. ME (27F) &amp; boyfriend (27M).,"  

QUESTION:

Am I in an abusive relationship? Is this person the right path for me? Should I continue on this road and hope we both grow?

Let's call him Sean.

GENERAL TIMELINE BACKGROUND:

· My SO &amp; I met at the young age of 3 years old. Went to PRE-K to 4th grade together. I had a mega crush on him in 1st grade, and when my 6 year old self found the courage to tell him, his reply was naturally....""Ew Cooties.""

· Through these years we attended birthday parties &amp; social events together as our parents were friends but he always hated me/thought i was ""weird AF.""

· I leave school in 4th grade, attend another school &amp; high school. We don't see each other.

· We bump into each other at the age of 18 as I'm on a date with another man at a bar where Sean is very drunk. We talk, he Facebook messages me, and a 'relationship' is born.

· Two years of casual ""dating""/hooking up as I'm away for college. Every break I spend wanting to be with him...

· I move back at age of 20 and we decide to give it a go. We date on and off for few months at a time.

· I leave him at age 21, because he kissed a girl on his bday in a club. Silly young things.

· Fast forward to age 23 we give it a more serious try. Dating for 3-4 months and then, he moves into my apartment with me out of necessity and desire.

· Now we moved into a better apt for (2) and at age 27 we're living comfortably together for 4/5 years.

BAGGAGE:

· I come from a childhood of abuse - physical, verbal, and emotional. I was abused by my parents from teenage years through adulthood. At age 21, I packed a bag and left, completely unprepared for life and very naive. I had narcissistic helicopter parents who kept me very dependent on them and not allowing me to develop my own judgement skills. So now, I cannot judge if my relationship IS or IS NOT healthy, if I am RIGHT or WRONG. I am no longer in touch with my parents. It hurts everyday to not have them though they hurt me.

· Sean has a case of being spoiled with opportunity. Always being given an opportunity whether it be a job hook up from a friend, a trip from a relative. Now understand...NOT spoiled at all but also NO fire in the belly.

TOGETHER AS A COUPLE:

We are the ""FUN COUPLE."" If you want to have a good time? If you want your night filled with laughs, jokes, culture, creativity, dancing, etc. You call us to be there. We poke fun at everyone and everything around us, even each other.

We care for one another.

He is great at deep cleaning the home and loves to cook. I enjoy revamping the home, filling our social calendar, and planning our lives together, making positive changes.

I am more of a planner, I enjoy planning ahead for trips, goals, and direction in life.

He takes things more day to day.

We enjoy most couple things from a night in of netflix, to a date night at a comedy show, to a beach day.

He and I are both great with each other's family. Both of our families treat the other like they are family.

MY DOUBTS SUMMARY:

We get into really hardcore arguments. I fear that I am the cause of them because this is how I was raised. I raise my voice and get very heated in topics of planning for the future...whether it be a vacation or deciding on a place to live. I feel he does not take life by the horns and direct it into a vision and rather let's life happen to us, allows us to be victims of circumstance.

SAMPLE ARGUMENT:

I raise my voice, he provokes me, i keep yelling, he throws a cup of water on me, i yell more, he calls me horrible names, i try to get him to listen to me, he refuses, storms off and the response i get is ""f\*ck off"" ""please leave me, i beg you""

Every other day we are leaving each other. I think we fear that this is really it for us now and it is the time of S\*it or get off the pot."" We have talked about marriage but again it seems far off and not like something he has given any planning to. I want things to be supportive and to move forward, but we keep cycling in this and not moving anywhere.

INSULTS:

His insults cut deep but i don;t think he means them at all.

While i do have a temper and yell and get frustrated...i do not insult.

We're on a diet and he caught me eating, saying, ""can't wait until your big belly comes back""

""i'd rather not have a gf that doesn't care about her looks""

""you're a cancer, this is why you have no family"" (the pain on this one is in explainable)

records me yelling at him and sends it to HIS mother.

He throws things, punches walls, etc.

""you're abusive just like your family""

""you're over sensitive""

""im moving out"" ""i'm done"" (every time we fight - which makes me freak out that i need to gather resources if i need to be on my own)

rude texts etc

This happens regularly, about twice a month. They vary in how bad they get, but they could happen after we have the BEST night together loving each other.

I am tired of living like this, in fear. I have for many many years. I am also tired of waiting for future plans. I'm not a girl that just wants a ring, but I fee like at this point we should know and should have a plan. I'm afraid of living in this endless cycle because I am used to it. I stay because I fear it will be this way with any man because I am the problem, the broken one.

I love him, I want him to have a happy life, but I too want a happy life.

Please weigh in on your thoughts or concerns.

Do you think our dynamic is toxic? Have you had experience in this?

How can I end this cycle?

How will I know he is the one for me? I wish we had more passion, but we have already been together for years and are comfortable.

Is this a cycle we will pass through because of the pressures that exist at our age of marriage and future planning?

Do you think the way I described us and our relationship should be the way a woman should describe the man she is considering spending her life with?

When we fight that badly, I plan to leave. I have no resources to do so, so I freak out and start my apartment search. I have even considered going to a shelter just to get away some days. By that time, he apologizes. I rationalize and also apologize for my part in it.",AskMen,"Is this abusive? Having serious doubts about my relationship with my long term S.O.

What can I do When partner ignores me during stress?,"Hi all, 

Im a bit in doubt about my relationship. Im having a relationship with a great guy (Well 90% of the time). We’re a year together and already talked about marriage. The problem is How he copes with stress. He alway withdraw When he has stress or problems with his sport. He is a top athlete So a lot of pressure and insecurities. For example he has to move a lot from country to country (he is a football player in europe). So I understand that he is going trough a lot. He told me in the beginning of our dating that he can be difficult and has phases that he is quiet. I didnt knew What he ment But now I do. 
It happend one time before When he had problems with his sponsors that he ignored me for weeks without saying something. In this period He isnt active on social media and he seems to be depressed. After he came back and said sorry and that he cant help How he handles stress. We promised that the next time When he stresses he will tell me he needs time. After a great halfyear of visiting eachother time to time Then suddenly he become distant again and didnt awnser my calls or text. I didnt knew What was going on and after a week i said it was over Since he doesnt have the respect To at least tell me What is going on. After I was Reading on the web that he got sold again to another football club (after Just a half year). So he has to start all over again in a new country. But he didnt told me this and Just ignored me again. I understand he is stressed But I dont understand he always have to stonewall without a word. Im worried What will happend When we are married. I read a lot articles about stonewalling man and some women have to deal with an distant man once in while. I really need advice. Because he hasnt spoke to me now Since three weeks, even after I apoligize and said that I hope he is doing good. Can you guys tell me whats going on in his mind, and What man has the same as him?

What is something you learned from/AskWomen that led to more positive interactions with women?,"Sorry I know there have been a lot of versions of this question, but I was just curious if anyone learned something positive from reading about women's lives that changed how they viewed/interacted with the women in their own lives? I know there's a lot of negative things guys might say about the /AskWomen sub and I understand that, but I wanted to see what positive impact, if any, it's had.

For me, reading /AskMen has been an eye-opener. It hasn't been positive in the sense that I've been surprised to read about how genuinely lonely a lot of guys are and how even little things like just wanting a hug keep coming up as a recurring theme. The very first post I ever read asked when the last time was that you had a physical contact with a girl. The replies really got to me, with some saying they hadn't had a hug in years. It may sound stupid, but after that, I made an effort just to give my single guy friends a casual hug when I saw them. Doubt it made much difference since I'm a married woman who's like a sister to them, but who knows, maybe it cheered them up a little bit. I've also been able to have more interesting conversations with my husband based on some of the posts -- like, what was your favorite moment in high school, what's something guys do that girls don't know about etc.

So has /AskWomen taught you something (positive) that you didn't know about women?

To me, unless I have to get back that night/early the next morning for whatever reason, I'll most likely ask to spend the night.  More often than not, we've been drinking and I would rather just sleep at her place for convenience sake. Most women that I've been with are open to that in my experience, however I can tell they seem slightly surprised/uncomfortable that I'm staying. My friends said in most cases they will get up and leave, no questions asked. I was honestly quite surprised... and I feel like I'm in the minority here.

Help me not be a clingy desperate looking woman!,"We’ve been talking for a couple of weeks. Had the first date and he kissed me for real. It was really hot and I was so aroused! We had our second date, he came over and we had some serious make out sessions and I asked him to stay the night. He left somewhat unexpectedly a while later saying he wasn’t feeling well. 

I guess I believe him. Before he left he made plans for us Wednesday and the following week too. But since then, I have been the one to initiate the communication. 

Let me be honest. I can’t quit thinking about him and I am obsessing a little. I am a grown ass woman who is financially and professionally successful. My son is an adult. I’m pretty. I’m a dam good catch!!!!

"New relationship, lower urge to masturbate.","Hi Reddit! Hope this is how it's done, wasn't sure where else on the internet to ask this.

I'm 26 and met a girl a few months ago, we've not had sex yet but it has been very very close to  happening, in bed watching TV or talking, together kissing, on top of eachother and so on from there.....

I've had a couple girlfriends in the past but never felt as strongly as as I do about this one (and so soon too) where habits definitely didn't really change.

Prior to meeting her I'd probably masturbated average 4 times a week.

That's now dropped to probably 4 or 5 times in the last 3 months. Eeeek.

I've just not felt ""the urge"" to and looking at porn does nothing for me, it also gave me feelings of it being kind of cheating or dishonest....?

How do I get over my regrets of not having more fun in college?,"A little context as to why this has gotten to me recently. I graduate college in May this year. I opted to go to community college to save money, then to commute to a small local school to save money and thus graduate debt free. I have a job lined up and got what everyone 'wants' out of college.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I went partying this weekend at a larger, also relatively local university. Nothing I haven't done before, but it kind of hit me this time. All of these people have been at this huge college partying it up for 4 years. They go on trips, live together, and basically have created a second family with one another. It's now dawning on me that I didn't get any of that. I've spent the last 4 years going to class, working out, playing video games, and hanging out with friends outside of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's starting to really hit me hard that I've wasted the best years of my life in terms of potential. All of the people I've met have traveled to countries together, party every weekend, and have just become so close that it makes me depressed almost that I missed out on that.

Is she being unreasonable?,"Hello guys, I’m a long time lurker first time poster.  Recently I have been having some issues with my girlfriend. For some context, I am a full time university student working a part time job, who needs to get his grades up this semester to avoid getting kicked out of my program; I had been having issues with my personal life that made me unable to focus on school but now I am trying to get my act together.  My girlfriend knows that this is going to be a tough semester for me and she says she understands. Two days ago I was trying to pull an all nighter for an exam I had the following afternoon while having two more assignments due the next day as well that I needed to complete, but was unable to stay up and I lost valuable time studying. In the morning I woke up feeling pretty bummed out and I was texting my girlfriend explaining to her that I wasn’t in the best mood because of what happened, and I wasn’t being as cheerful in text as I usually am. While she tried to motivate me, later we talked and she said she was feeling sad but wouldn’t exactly say the reason, and then later she decided that she was mad at me for being sad because apparently I was being cold in text. I explained to her that it wasn’t my intention I was just bummed out because I had a lot on my plate, which was one of the first things I mentioned to her in the morning. We had a long talk/ argument over it and it took away time from me doing my other assignments. Eventually we settled things, then later that night I was telling her that I needed to do my assignments and I continued to have a conversation with her as I did them, although I wasn’t responding as quickly. Eventually she said goodnight to me, but it was around the same time where I was trying to take a breather and accidentally fell asleep. She doesn’t like when I fall asleep on her and don’t say goodnight back and I have done this multiple times before accidentally..This morning she asked me about it and I told her that I accidentally fell asleep and that I wasn’t even trying to ignore her, since I had stated to her that I was trying to stay up to do my assignment anyway and that I have a tendency to fall asleep really quickly sometimes even when I don’t think I’m that tired. This ended up getting us into another argument as she could not believe I fell asleep so quickly since she responded within a minute to the last text I sent her.  I do like her a lot but I wish we wouldn’t argue over things like this. Is she being unreasonable, or should I try to be better

How are you navigating the modern day dating landscape?,"I just watched the Fyre Festival documentary on Netflix and it really called out some problems with social media platforms. Long story short, a brilliant marketing plan involving Instagram models and other social media as leverage to promote an island luxury music festival fell completely short of expectations. That might be underselling the catastrophic failure the festival was, but when it actually occurred a lot of media outlets blamed millennials for just wanting to cash in on some internet points by attending the festival. I couldn't help but think about some dating apps in the same light. 

Obviously, it isn't a perfect comparison, but sometimes it seems like these apps are just used for promoting other media platforms or just swiping as a confidence booster in an ongoing effort to gain media clout. 

I'm in the opinion that the never-ending blast of media that results in us comparing ourselves to someone else's highlight reel is pretty dangerous. Dating apps pool you in with 1000s of other people who are either just messing around or trying to promote their media platforms. Instagram shows you the best parts of someone's life and it can be hard not to measure yourself up against them. Essentially, you are creating a fictitious reality where you idealize someone just based on some boxes. Sometimes without ever meeting the person! How can you ever really differentiate the good from the bad?

To me, it's just so ambiguous. It's becoming harder and harder to judge someone's intentions when dating. In the sense that, even when going on dates, can you ever really trust that they aren't still waiting on their next swipe? Are they talking to 2-3-4 other people at the same time? I feel that by someones next date being literally a swipe away, its just creating a waiting pool for people to just plod around, stuck in neutral. I get you should be picky about who you date and be confident in yourself, but the dating landscape just seems untrustworthy and ambiguous to me when talking about social media. 

It's an over-availability that is impacting commitment. I've seen it occur both in initial dating and in longer-term relationships. I've seen a friend in a LTR literally see someones Instagram and then question his current relationship. Or I have a friend who is talking to 3-4 people daily on dating apps while going on dates. That just doesn't seem right to me.

How have you dealt with emotional abuse from dating/relationships?,"Hey everyone, I would like to attempt to get people's input on how to deal with anger and resentment due to emotional abuse in dating and relationships.

Long story short, as a man in his mid-30s who is still single, I have been through some very toxic relationships where I was abused emotionally and physically by various girlfriends. Due to this I have found that I have a lot of resentment because when I have shared my experiences, the result is almost always that I must have done something wrong to deserve what happened and/or instigated the abuse.

"""I understand"" vs. ""I empathize."" What's your preferred word choice?","Hi men! My husband and I were having a discussion the other day and we both decided to get some new perspectives. I'd love your input!

A lot of women in my life have a canned phrase we use when trying to empathize with a man. We typically say, ""I understand."" We mean this to say we can see where you're coming from.

However, my husband's logic is that this phrase is dismissive. Because there are some things a woman *can't* understand, but we can empathize with.

An example: When interviewing someone at a Pro-Life rally, if a man gives his perspective on the issue, the woman responds with, ""I understand.""

How can I stop hating work?,"I hate my job. I hate going to my job. Returning to work on the Monday after the Christmas holiday my inner child trowed a tauntum. I really, really, really didn’t want to go back to work. I almost fell to the floor fighting this feeling.

I’m 33 year old man, been working for about 6-7 years in a regular office job. Bosses and colleagues usally like me, I have gotten good references and done quite well for myself. I got my own office, am sligthly overpayed and my bosses rarley bothers me. And still ... I hate my job. I realize how ungrateful and immature this may seem, because it is. But I can’t change how I feel.

The nature of my job is, the more driven and ambitious I am, the more work it generates for me. I had periods when I’ve been so stressed I felt ill and had trouble sleeping. The ”success” or praise made no difference in how soul crushing I found my job. So I’ve stopped trying so hard, ”It’s just a job after all”. That helped, but I still feel like I am dying slowly inside. I try to do the things I do well, but make sure I get a plenty of chill time also.

The problem is not my job, but that I don’t want to work. I had a longer leave from working last year and I never been happier in my life. A few years ago I only worked 30ish hours a week, that helped. So less work = more happiness.

Again, I am not blind to my immature and perhaps entitled feelings. But how do I change? How do I grow up and reconcile with the fact that work is a part of life? So I don’t have to fight my inner tauntrum every single day for the rest of my life? (No retirement for our generation, fyi)

"Straight Men Like Catfish, An Examination","Ok so, I am a gay dude and I have been running a study with a catfish account and it is more effective for hooking up than Grindr. If I were a total ho I could hook up with a hot, young, charismatic straight boy per day. (I just give bjs)

I think the reason is multi-fold:

1) straight men need more sex than is easily attained even in today's society

2) it is in fact possible to be straight and let a guy give you a bj

3) straight men do not get enough validation from potential mates - I think it is the patriarchy at work - and they need someone to want them badly. It appears women can only express a strong interest after a certain stage is reached while the guy has to sit in the discomfort of not knowing if he is attractive to anyone

So, it seems to me that most men, if they think nobody will know, are down to let a guy suck them off.

How do I get over a coworker I fell in love with?,"I(M21) currently work at a retail store  while I finish up my bachelor's and have grown really close to one of my  coworkers(F24) over the past few months. It was organic as I wasn't  actively pursuing her. It sort of just happened. We sometimes can't keep our hands off each other  at work. We finally went out for the first time the last week. I was worried I wouldn’t have enough to talk about, but there wasn’t a single moment of silence in those 3 hours. At the restaurant, she came out and explained that we can't date because work relationships  almost always end bad. She cited her past experiences of dating coworkers and how it has given her a hard time (Guess she came to her  senses and wanted to set things straight). And I totally understand  that. 

The phrase ""don't shit where you eat"" isn't around for nothing.  She acknowledged that had we not worked at the same place, things would  have been different (she said “well when you get out (of college), hit me up). She drove me home, we kissed (to get my first kiss out of the way) and that was that.

How do you guys stay motivated to workout when there is nothing to workout FOR per se?",AskMen,"How do you guys stay motivated to exercise and workout regularly/stay healthy?So I’ve always been pretty fit and in decent shape, always looking to loose a couple more pounds or lean up but it feels like I have no motivation anymore (23m) I’m pretty goal or objective oriented and this type of thing is hard for me.

How do I get myself to stop wanting a relationship so badly?,"I'm a 20yo male in my sophomore year of college. I've never been in a relationship before. I find myself suffering from increasingly depressing and palpable loneliness, in addition to being convinced that there is something seriously wrong with me. I used to be very heavy (5'9"", 258 --&gt; 189) and I still feel that way deep down. I am told I am a good looking guy and that I don't look fat, but I never believe it. I am generally a very confident person in all other respects of my life but this one. But I'm inexplicably cursed to living like this. I am a generally well-meaning, accomplished, and acclaimed person. People like me, and I'm hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't. But here I am.

However, the only answers I can find are to turn my struggle inwards. I won't find solutions to my problems in others but within myself. The only problem is that I am not happy with just myself. I need to quell my desire for companionship completely. The only solution I've found thus far is slapping myself in the face every time I think about/imagine/want a relationship in any capacity. Yesterday I slapped myself in the face so many times that I felt ashamed, and it actually hurt after a while. This is not healthy, but neither is the crushing loneliness. This is the only solution at hand because indulging in negative thoughts and imaginations of what I really want is too easy. I've recently quit smoking weed (15 days), so my one outlet to keep those things at bay is not an option anymore.

Not gonna lie, I feel a bit insecure about the idea of going to a place where she might get hit on a ton even if I'm there with her.

How to meet more people (girls),"I'm 24 years old and looking for some advice on how to meet girls. I have a solid job in finance, a car, genuine hobbies, work out in the gym multiple times a week, at least decently if not quite attractive physically, not a drug user and have friends I see often. I would say I am not necessarily shy but often reserved and conservative, though I am able to approach/initiate contact with girls. I do still live with my parents.

My social life and work especially are pretty much dead ends for meeting girls at the moment, outside of going to bars/clubs with friends. My hobbies and interests are very male oriented and would be difficult to meet girls through.

I've tried tinder, bumble and all that sort of thing but it's a bit of a black hole as far as my experience. I've probably met up with 20 or so girls from apps and dated one for about 6 months (she moved away, ended positively). But frankly I seem to be less successful as of late and not sure if it's just me but it seems like it's (I'm?) not as popular anymore. I get matches fine but response rates and meetups have gone down. Regardless I don't think they're good places to meet a potential girlfriend, not that I was ever specifically using them for that.

I figure I need to try more in real life, my text 'game' isn't great anyway and I'd say I'm much more attractive in person compared to 2D pictures, as most people would be.

I know I mentioned bars and clubs but I feel like they're the real world version of dating apps and not really the best place to meet a partner either. I know beggars can't be choosers but I feel like I'd prefer to meet someone in a place that is a little more wholesome.

So far I've come up with the following ideas that I would actually do and might provide good opportunities to meet girls or at least expand my social circle to meet more, what else can you guys think of? I'd at least like things that have some sort of 'forced' social interaction instead of having to approach random strangers.

* Fitness classes/group training

* Language classes

* Getting another job that I could do maybe one day on weekends

* Volunteer work of some description

* Using my dog - like dog parks or beaches, bit more random but may work

Other ideas or things I've thought of that don't seem great

* Speed dating - Seems better suited to people a bit older (late 20s+)

* Meetup.com - Doesn't seem to be anything that relevant in my area

How do I reply to the question 'Is that all you think of me?' after saying something horny to her.,"So my first date quite well, we hold hands, she was turned on like crazy and stuff.
Today I told her that when I think of her, I get a boner and feel aroused, 
she replies that I'm the first one to make her feel this way as well, 
but she's asking me if thats all I feel when I think of her.

What should I say to her in this case? 
If I tell her stuff like I also feel love then that would probably come off as fake?

Why did my ex add me?,"My ex and I were together for a little over two years. I had some serious mental health issues that weren't diagnosed until after we broke up. Our breakup actually pushed me to see a doctor. During our relationship, he smashed my phone to where it didn't work and I had to get a new one.  We broke up after an argument that ended in him punching me in the leg, leaving me paralyzed on his floor for a solid 5 minutes when he eventually picked me up and placed me on his porch, locking the door behind him. A couple days later, he apologized. 

Fast forward to today, I've been with my current boyfriend for 4 years and we have two kids together. He added me on Facebook. I know he had to unblock me because periodically I would try to find him. I asked him why he added me and he said to see how I was doing. I did a little investigating and it seems like his relationship just recently ended. The girl he was dating was a friend (not close) who I had warned about him. I don't know what prompted their breakup. 

Anyway, I'm really shook up about this. I would always try to stalk his pages, but now he adds me and I'm freaked? What's going on in my brain?

I have been doing the Cobra stretch, jumping jacks, drinking milk, and eating fruits, vegetables, meat, and rice. I see no difference in my height compared to 2-4 years ago. My oldest brother plays basketball and exercises, while my second brother doesn't exercise and eats a lot of junk food yet he's taller. Also, my oldest brother and I eat in much more quantities than my second brother, yet he's the tallest.

Since I'm the youngest, shouldn't I be taller than my older brothers as the middle brother is taller than the oldest right now. At 18, will I continue to grow up until my mid-20s? How do I do it? My feet and hand sizes are larger than both of my brothers yet I'm the shortest. WTF!?

How to meet girls,"I'm 24 years old and looking for some advice on how to meet girls. I have a solid job in finance, a car, genuine hobbies, work out in the gym multiple times a week, at least decently if not quite attractive physically, not a drug user and have friends I see often. I would say I am not necessarily shy but often reserved and conservative, though I am able to approach/initiate contact with girls. I do still live with my parents.

My social life and work especially are pretty much dead ends for meeting girls at the moment, outside of going to bars/clubs with friends. My hobbies and interests are very male oriented and would be difficult to meet girls through.

I've tried tinder, bumble and all that sort of thing but it's a bit of a black hole as far as my experience. I've probably met up with 20 or so girls from apps and dated one for about 6 months (she moved away, ended positively). But frankly I seem to be less successful as of late and not sure if it's just me but it seems like it's (I'm?) not as popular anymore. I get matches fine but response rates and meetups have gone down. Regardless I don't think they're good places to meet a potential girlfriend, not that I was ever specifically using them for that.

I figure I need to try more in real life, my text 'game' isn't great anyway and I'd say I'm much more attractive in person compared to 2D pictures, as most people would be.

I know I mentioned bars and clubs but I feel like they're the real world version of dating apps and not really the best place to meet a partner either. I know beggars can't be choosers but I feel like I'd prefer to meet someone in a place that is a little more wholesome.

So far I've come up with the following ideas that I would actually do and might provide good opportunities to meet girls or at least expand my social circle to meet more, what else can you guys think of? I'd at least like things that have some sort of 'forced' social interaction instead of having to approach random strangers.

* Fitness classes/group training

* Language classes

* Getting another job that I could do maybe one day on weekends

* Volunteer work of some description

* Using my dog - like dog parks or beaches, bit more random but may work

Other ideas or things I've thought of that don't seem great

* Speed dating - Seems better suited to people a bit older (late 20s+)

* Meetup.com - Doesn't seem to be anything that relevant in my area

* Yoga - tried it a few times (more for some stress I was going through at the time) and didn't seem like the right kind of environment, at least the place I went to - wasn't social at all.",AskMen,"How to meet girlsI'm 24 years old and looking for some advice on how to meet girls.

"Any other chronic boob starers out there? If so, how have you dealt with it, if at all?","I’ll admit that when it comes to boobs, I definitely go overboard. Gigantic boobs are just something I absolutely love and can’t get enough of. I’ve tried to quit watching porn, but I just can’t find a good enough reason to go without the boobies.

Sometimes it really feels harmful. I feel like a dork saying this, but if there’s a girl who has giant boobs and is wearing a tight shirt with no bra, I will (and have, many times) have a very, very strong urge to just stare at them, even though I understand she’s a person, that she probably doesn’t want me to, that it may ruin future interactions with them, that it generally sucks and isn’t something I should do.

I mean, sometimes I’ll go out of my way to take certain routes I wouldn’t usually walk if I see a woman with giant boobs without a bra (in my living situation and in my current stage of life, this comes up a lot).

I consider myself a feminist, and I totally understand that I’m probably not nearly as discrete as I think I am, and that I probably have caused several women to be pretty uncomfortable. I’ve never followed anyone home, or been overtly caught. It’s just strange to me that even though I understand the damage I could do, looking at them literally feels so good that I logically deduce sometimes that it’s worth it.

I feel really weird about it. I really want to fix it completely. But is there anybody else that shares a similar thing?

I will also add that I’m in a relationship, which makes things feel way worse.

How can I (19m) reverse the effects of casual sex?,"So I've (19m) never been one to have sex with anyone, until I went through a self destructive phase and slept with 14 women in a four month time span.

FWB or dating? Starting to think I (24F) misread what signals he (late 20s M) gave me.,"So this is weird and I kind of want some advice on how to think about it.

So I started hooking up with this guy a while back, I hooked up with him the night we met and then he asked me out afterwards. Our first ‘date’, I actually had to initiate us hooking up afterwards. For the first few months, everytime we hooked up he would always take me to a nice dinner or something first, and then I would go home with him afterwards. After a while it transitioned to me coming over, watching a movie or something and then hooking up. Well, the last few months, we haven’t really planned those as much anymore because I’ve been bootycalling him about once a month (admittedly, I’ve been drunk everytime). But it’s weird, because everytime I bootycall him, he wants to plan something for a couple days away, or even the next day, but doesn’t want me to come over then. I’ll end up persuading him to let me come over, but it’s weird to me I guess? (Yes, I know it’s wrong to persuade him, I’m always mortified the next morning when I’m sober.) Like if he wants to hook up with me enough that he’ll do it tomorrow, why not tonight? Better yet, why not both lol.

I guess I’m just confused on the guy and where he’s coming from. At the beginning when we were going on dates, I got the vibe that he was trying to date me. But then, we never talked in between our dates. We would only talk when we were setting up a date (we usually went out once a week or so), and then we would obviously talk on the date, etc., but I just got the feeling that if he’s not trying to talk to me outside of a night when we’re going to hook up afterwards, then we’re probably just fwb. I wouldn’t really be opposed to dating the guy, so I want to get some advice on what the guy’s intentions are in your opinions, so that I can try to treat him either as a fwb or a guy that I could potentially date. I feel like he’s getting offended that the only time I message him now is when I’m bootycalling him.

TL;DR I’ve been hooking up/dating a guy kind of on/off for a while and am unsure if he’s trying to date me or just hook up with me. Don’t really have a preference between the two, but I want to make sure that I’m not offending the guy by treating him like a fwb when he’s trying to date me.",AskMen,"FWB or dating?

Could you date someone who hooked up with multiple friends in a rough patch of their life?,"I’ve posted the backstory in more detail elsewhere, sorry if anyone is reading through this again. I'm looking for any input or help in thinking through the situation and finding the best path forward.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened

&gt;I used to be great friends with this girl back in HS. She wasn’t the hooking up type back then at all, we weren't together in that sense but we connected more that normal friends.  
&gt;  
&gt;She was in a brutal (cops getting involved fairly often) years long on and off relationship relationship after that and it totally changed her. I heard through the grapevine that she was sleeping around some in the “off” periods of this relationship (I didn’t think I was getting involved with a nun).  
&gt;  
&gt;I move back home this summer and we started seeing each other casually but exclusively for about a month. It went horribly - not the girl I remembered AT ALL. She wasn’t eating, was extremely under weight, was drinking and abusing prescriptions, and was just cruel. I broke it off cut all contact because I didn’t want that in my life.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a terrible case of timing - we had a reunion the following weekend with all our friends in town. She went home with a friend night 1, woke up full of regret (texted him “that was terrible, I’m trying to be with mannymarquez, please don’t talk to me anymore”), but continued to party and had a blackout hookup with a different friend night 2. I was around but didn’t know she went home with either of my friends - I saw a little night one but in general I was trying to be as distanced from her as possible. Neither guy knew about our situation at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

The aftermath

&gt;We didn’t talk for about a month until she randomly reached out to me. The general idea was “I’m terribly sorry for my insane self-destructive behavior (direct quote), I hate how I treated you and pushed you away, and my life is off track but I want to change.” She also said she knew we couldn’t have a relationship but she just wanted me in her life again as a friend if that was possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;She sounded genuine and we met as friends. That lasted about a week. We hit it off so well and so quickly that we’ve been inseparable for the past 6-7 months. There are bumps now and then but she’s changed so much in this time. She’s so much of what I remember and so little of that dark angry person I saw this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the problem?

&gt;I had no idea about the details of that weekend (thought she was apologizing for her general behavior). I found out about the first night and she told me about the second. She thought I knew about both because we have the same social circle and they’re not exactly people who stay quiet - she thought I just didn’t want to talk about it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m struggling on two fronts. Firstly I just can’t shake the thought of what happened from my head some days. I look at her and wonder to myself - how could you even do that to someone? Second, the reminders are everywhere. When people come home and we all get together for the holidays, boom. When I go out on the weekend, boom. Open social media, boom. Imagine being in the same room as your girlfriend, two dudes who hooked up with her on consecutive nights, and your best friends who know all the dirt - it’s happened and it’s just not fun.

How much does the physical attractiveness of a woman matter to you when she gives you a platonic compliment?,"So, in short, I'm an unattractive woman. I try my best with makeup, maintain a good hygiene, always smile and I try so hard to give off a happy/cheerful attitude etc. But that doesn't change my body size, which for most is 90% of an impression and therefore my biggest physical flaw. 

However, that did not stop me from trying to give men more compliments.
After reading a post about how men got fewer platonic compliments and how they were so happy when they first got one, I realized ""you know what, I have been holding back with men!"" so I started giving guys more ""Hey I like your shirt"" comments or complimented stuff I noticed and could tell they put a little effort into, all that stuff right?

But now I'm back to wishing I never tried to because I feel like I'm being ignored and maybe laughed at.

I never expected anyone to react over the top- a compliment is about making the other person feel good, not yourself, so it shouldn't matter to me how ""much"" they reacted- but I at least expected something?

For example, my female friends always smile or get giddy and excited if I compliment their makeup or something, but every time I genuinely gave a male friend/acquaintance a compliment they seemed to either ignore it or brush it off!
Of course some of them smiled, but I'd say only 2/10 did, and I was so careful not to be weird about it...
 
So, I tried to figure out why I was struggling so hard, cause it wasn't like I had to force myself- I genuinely wanted to compliment them- and now all my thoughts are automatically going to my looks, because honestly, my much more attractive friend can bring a giant smile to any guys face by simply saying hi. 

Therefore my question is, do compliments from unattractive women impact you less, or are guys in general just less vissibly happy about compliments?

I never expected anyone to react over the top- a compliment is about making the other person feel good, not yourself, so it shouldn't matter to me how ""much"" they reacted- but I at least expected something?

For example, my female friends always smile or get giddy and excited if I compliment their makeup or something, but every time I genuinely gave a male friend/acquaintance a compliment they seemed to either ignore it or brush it off!
Of course some of them smiled, but I'd say only 2/10 did, and I was so careful not to be weird about it...
 
So, I tried to figure out why I was struggling so hard, cause it wasn't like I had to force myself- I genuinely wanted to compliment them- and now all my thoughts are automatically going to my looks, because honestly, my much more attractive friend can bring a giant smile to any guys face by simply saying hi. 

Therefore my question is, do compliments from unattractive women impact you less, or are guys in general just less vissibly happy about compliments? "
How to deal with a seemingly inevitable break up?,"(apologies for the lengthy post, but I would really appreciate some words of wisdom...)

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 2 years, and it has come to the point where differences that were always present are now becoming the downfall of our relationship. Minor differences are become major issues and I am struggling to have a normal conversation with her, without it becoming an argument of judgement over opinion.

I've been going through a rough mental health stint over the past 2 months, and this has definitely played a role in not being the person that she deserves. While this is no excuse whatsoever, I am struggling to be the confident man I want to be for her.

Am I causing myself/the relationship more harm than good by trying to work through it, or should I just face the facts and consider ending it before it gets worse?

I truly don't know what I am doing wrong and I would like some male perspective. What am I doing wrong with my approaches for dating?,"Hello, first time poster here blah blah. Semi long post, but any advice would be appreciated.

I (F~~19~~ 20 as of today) have been ""looking for love"" since I was 12 or so, maybe because of all the fantasies from the books I would read/movies I watched when I was younger or because of my narcissist parents who left me starved for attention. Who knows. Point is, I've been on I'd say around 100-200 dates from age \~16 to now, and interacted with hundreds of men and only once it has worked out (later turned into an emotionally and physically abusive relationship and I had to break up with him after a year). 

I find that despite who messaged first/made a move first/where I met them/how good the dates are (in my opinion anyway) I am constantly being ghosted after really big gestures indicating that they like me back. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few examples:

Went on three dates with an American guy (I'm Canadian - he was in point roberts so it's really close) and he had $200  flowers sent to my work for no reason with a note saying ""I may be jumping the gun with this, but if anyone deserves to get flowers randomly it should be you."" Like aw? Super sweet. And then one more date and he ghosted me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met this guy from Sacramento who was visiting in Van and he was really pressing that when he's back in Van for winter break he wanted to take me out. He comes back, we confirm the date and time, then he bails on me. I write it off, delete his # and enjoy my break. Then a week later, I get a text from him and a 30 minute long phone call about how he is so sorry and he asks for another chance. I figured, whatever, I'm free that day, sure. Then he ghosts me and bails for the second date. Ok? even if he was just going to be a fuckboy and just try to sleep with me he didn't even try to do that so why waste everyone's time?

&amp;#x200B;

Third guy I met in LA when visiting, he and I had an awesome date, kept in touch and I am headed down there (with a friend) soon to see who I really like honestly, but he seems to be texting and calling me a lot less (we would talk on the phone for hours like 3-5 a night at the start) so why is it cool to keep in touch for like 2 months and now when I can actually see you again you seem to be disappearing? I dunno. 

Maybe I should just stop wanting to date Americans? lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also gone on countless dates with Canadian dudes close by to me and they all seem to be really interested and THEY ask to see me again and then when I text the day before or so to confirm plans they always ghost or bail. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm ugly? Damn, y'all IDK. If you PM me I can send you a photo of myself and you can decide. I try to be hyperaware of my interactions (make sure I don't make it all about me, ask tons of questions, find mutual interests to discuss, be nice, split the bill, blah blah blah) I don't know what more to do.

Once every week or so some guy would do more than ask for my number like follow me for a while or try to touch me. Basically not at all accept a no.

Gay dating; getting past the first step(s),"Hey guys,

I’m a relatively young (20-25 yo) gay guy who’s still fairly new to the dating scene. I’ve had a couple of boyfriends and they were really lovely and I’m still in contact but didn’t really get much of a spark in me physically. I think I know my type as I’ve had my fair share of crushes over the years, but I’m finding meeting potential boyfriends to be a bit tricky. I like to think I’m an OK looking guy, I’m fairly smart and have a decent job, lots of hobbies and friends.

I live in a fairly rural part of the UK so it’s not exactly gay dating paradise, so I tend to use dating apps or sites quite a bit, but I struggle to get past the first couple of messages with somebody I’m really interested in on a dating site, or to bump into somebody in real life that I really hit it off with (and it being obvious that they’re interested). I can see location being a bit of a problem with the happening to bump into somebody thing, but tips for both would be much appreciated.

I read another post on here about a guy struggling to get girls, and somebody suggested confidence was key. I like to think I’m fairly confident, but a colleague who was (brutally!) honest at one point accused me of not having a sense of humour, after which I seemed to subconsciously loosen up and let my (slightly rude and sarcastic) sense of humour out. No more accusations of having no sense of humour now! This makes me wonder if I’m not managing to get my personality and sense of humour across quickly enough to keep people interested, but surely you have to get to know people a bit first?

I’ve had a couple of boyfriends and they were really lovely and I’m still in contact but didn’t really get much of a spark in me physically. I think I know my type as I’ve had my fair share of crushes over the years, but I’m finding meeting potential boyfriends to be a bit tricky. I like to think I’m an OK looking guy, I’m fairly smart and have a decent job, lots of hobbies and friends.

I live in a fairly rural part of the UK so it’s not exactly gay dating paradise, so I tend to use dating apps or sites quite a bit, but I struggle to get past the first couple of messages with somebody I’m really interested in on a dating site, or to bump into somebody in real life that I really hit it off with (and it being obvious that they’re interested). I can see location being a bit of a problem with the happening to bump into somebody thing, but tips for both would be much appreciated.

I read another post on here about a guy struggling to get girls, and somebody suggested confidence was key. I like to think I’m fairly confident, but a colleague who was (brutally!) honest at one point accused me of not having a sense of humour, after which I seemed to subconsciously loosen up and let my (slightly rude and sarcastic) sense of humour out. No more accusations of having no sense of humour now! This makes me wonder if I’m not managing to get my personality and sense of humour across quickly enough to keep people interested, but surely you have to get to know people a bit first?

Any hints, tips or similar experiences please?"
Why do so many men send random dick pics?,"It’s so fucking annoying. I have so many requests on instagram with men who just send me random dick pics.

How can I look more straight?,"I know this is a weird one, but I’m a heterosexual man and a lot of other guys always eventually end up asking me if I’m gay.

I never mind it’s a harmless question and admittedly I give off some sort of vibe but it’s just who I am.

Anyways, I may be overthinking it and wondered if maybe that’s why I’m not getting a lot of attention from women. Is there something I can do that just automatically tells people I’m straight, or is this one of those “being a man is just accepting who you are” kinds of thing that I’m totally for but just not sure if it’s something I *can* change.",AskMen,"How can I look more straight?I know this is a weird one, but I’m a heterosexual man and a lot of other guys always eventually end up asking me if I’m gay.

"Atheists, how much do you secretly envy the religious?","So my grandmother died about 2 months ago in a few days. We were pretty close but I wasnt living with her everyday so I didnt feel the impact as much as my parent did of course.

But it's so wierd. I felt like what happened wasnt evèn real. It just boggles my mind. How can a person just fucking dissapear? Poof. Gone. Where did they go? So many unanswered questions with nobody to answer them. I'm graduating college soon and she would've been there had cancer not taken her.

I'm a very rational and scientific person. I dont believe in an afterlife which makes my loss that much more difficult to deal with. To me, shes gone. She doesn't exist anymore. I'm never going to see her again. I view existence as suffering. Whatever you do, you suffer to get it done. This is hell and heaven is non existence.

This got me thinking more about God and religion and honestly, in a way I really envy super religious people. The people who really and truly believe that this is not the end and that theres something else after this.

Does my ex bf/ fwb care about me or still have some feelings left about me?,"Context: my friend with benefits is my ex boyfriend and my male best friend. 

We have been friends for almost 3 years no and we even had a short relationship but I had extremely strong feelings for him, as he was my first love. We broke up almost a year ago and it was messy af. However, we stayed very good friends  in the end and we hook up from time to time (when he is single, of course). We had several fights about our relationship and whenever he got into another relationship I would get jealous and angry and argue with him. I would reproach him that he does not give a fuck about me and other typical things women reproach to men. To which he would tell me in many occasions that he cares about me and he likes me, but not that way and that he does give a fuck about me. He also told me many times that he finds me attractive and that we have a lot in common and he tried his best to make me happy, but he just could not be in a relationship with me. 

Despite it all, we still get along and we make up after every fight. Also, we are still pretty open to eachother and we tell eachother pretty much everything. And even though we do not talk as often as we used to and even if I text him first, he always replies and does not mind me texting him- he says I don't bother him. What is more, he almost never refuses me when I ask him if we could meet. 

To the subject: Now, we have a friendship/friends with benefits kind of relationship. When we have sex, we kiss a lot and he tries his best to help me get orgasms, and would be dissapointed if he failed or would be sad if he saw me crying post coitus (that's another story, I am that messed up).

Last time we hooked up, the sex was very good and he seemed to put al lot of effort in making me to have a orgasm. But what surprised me is that he kissed me on my forehead several times during the intercourse. And at the end of the day, before I went home, he hugged me. (It's not the first time he did this though). Do forehead kisses and hugs mean anything in this case?

Does all of this mean something? Do I still mean something to him?

Thanks in advance :)"

How do you tell your mom to let you live your life?,"Hey all

So let me preface this briefly:
-I’m 25, went to college, graduated and moved back home, got a job.
-I’ve had a few relationships but broke up with my last girlfriend about 2 years ago

I was in a 3-year relationship that ended 1 year out of college, the last 2 years were long distance, but close enough to drive for weekends. We broke up two years ago. Then I moved out and it was about a year of dating girl after girl, not really being content with any of them, just kind of bumping around in that crowd.

I don’t remember when exactly, I believe it was when I got an STD I didn’t know what to do so I asked my mom. It’s cringey but I honestly didn’t know what to do. It was honestly fine in the end, but it kind of started a spiral downwards emotionally.

Over the last year or so, I drifted apart from a lot of my friends. Those typical 20-something reasons. Girlfriends, moving, living too far, and so on.

—

So what? I started to bitch to my mom. Just about anything I was going through. I didn’t know what else to do.
 
I kept talking to my mom to help me “get through this stuff.” I started reading about CBT and that helped for a while. But then a really particularly nasty work trip got me so down that I needed someone again. And before you go judging, it was multi-continental, no-two-nights-in-the-same-place, very stressful. I do actually enjoy my job but this was my low point. Then I had an issue with my back getting injured. In a lot of this, I would sort of bitch about it and/or give status updates to my mom. There was just a lot of bad stuff I was going through and I didn’t really feel that I had anybody else, and I felt that I needed somebody.

The problem became that as soon as I ever felt better or things started looking up, she would return and use me as her support. I couldn’t get better because the second things start looking up for me, she would be calling me freaking out about something. A lot of it is minor stupid stuff like how my dad reacts to something. But then it was my older family member being sick. Or the car is broke down. Or the whatever.

I read No More Mr Nice Guy a few months ago and realized that’s what I had become, or been. My mom was so involved in my life, and I had very little contact with friends. And she still is but now I feel kind of stuck.

—

So I tried to stop giving status updates. But then she would inquire. I would try to tell her no, and it worked for that particular issue. But then it would become something else was an issue, like a family member being very sick. Surely this had to be above my boundaries. The second she got something big through, 400 little things followed. Then my brother would call to bitch, so I’d bitch to my mom because she’s the only person who would get it. It’s like this system where it’s designed to keep you trapped. I tried not answering texts and calls, but then a holiday comes and it starts over again.

I’ve straight up said “mom, you are actually messing me up by trying to intrude like this, please just let me live my life.” But then it becomes “I’m the only one who is always here for you. I need to deal with my own problems but you are always so helpful to me.” This passive aggressive gaslighting that basically makes me feel like I’m a bad son that I don’t want a constant line of communication with my mom.

And I believe I am now at a very bad place.

-I can tell in the back of my mind, I’m afraid to make a decision because some part of me feels the need to confer with my mother, even if I don’t, it just hazes my thinking just enough.

-I am afraid to hang out with people a little bit because I worry that I may forget about some plan I made with somebody and it will be a big deal.

-Even getting my dad involved, he will pick at things I do and I will get self conscious about them.

-I’m starting to lose trust in people, and even myself. This was a CBT “find” about why I am afraid to do stuff like go out and buy groceries (sometimes, I do it eventually but I wait until I have no food some weeks) and why I’m afraid to go out and do stuff alone, etc. Why I latch to my friends at the bar and don’t mingle. Mostly I just feel very afraid, and I feel like I don’t trust people.

-To be honest, I am afraid to talk to my friends about it because I feel like people just don’t talk about their family problems to their friends. Maybe it’s me, I have always been annoyed by that because I never know them and there is usually more to the story than they are giving.

I know that my mom is not technically the real issue here, it’s me. But I try to say, I spend about 15-20 minutes minimum per day dealing with her as a single 25 year old. She has a husband, a job, a house. My brother doesn’t do this. I just don’t see myself getting better with her hovering constantly. I constantly feel like I need to have an excuse to do everything. What’s the excuse to going out for a walk? Or going out to the bars alone?

It has really worn down my attitude, and I have told her this straight up but she keeps coming back trying to guilt me to go see my family (which I do probably once every two weeks minimum, which is a LOT from what I gather) and all this stuff. She just needs to lay off. I’ve had cousins tell me this straight up, she’s hounding them. She wants to take care of all of my problems for me. And like I can’t get her to stay out of any of my business.

And perhaps the worst (maybe most telling) part about all of this is that my “digging up my past” has kind of revealed two major things.

1) She and my dad were practically absent workaholics. Me and my brother were latchkey kids, and my brother would basically kick the shit out of me so he could have the house to himself when they weren’t home. This is to say, nobody helicoptered me back then, when I needed it.

2) Every time I broke up with a girl or just treated her less than expected, it was always preceded by one of these 1-2 hour bitch-fests to my mom about every problem we had and my mom telling me that’s not normal. I’m not blaming my mom, but only now has that really popped up. And it is evident, I realize to a degree all the girls I date, they’re dating me but they’re really dating my mom too.

And I will be clear, I don’t want any of this. I want to be healthy. I just feel that really my mom is now clinging to me to the point where I need a lot of space for a while and she just won’t take the direct communication, but it’s like she isn’t abusing me. She’s “trying to help.” She just won’t stop. It’s always one week and right back to abnormal.

—

Sorry for the TMI, but it’s just bottled up and I am so used to walking on eggshells (probably because of this issue) that I feel like I need to include it so I don’t get misconstrued.

I’m hoping somebody reads even just some of it and knows my situation and can offer a remedy.

How do you handle your girlfriend's anxiety?,"Alright, so I just started dating this wonderful girl. She's everything I could ever ask for and treats me so well. 
However, she suffers from some serious anxiety and when an attack comes, she goes completely cold and shuts down. She says she wants me to be there for her but when I try to, she either doesn't say anything or just tells me to go to bed or she'll talk to me later, depending on the time of day. This usually makes me feel angry at myself, like I'm saying or doing all the wrong things.

I hate leaving her alone in these situations, but also don't want to smother her and make her feel even more anxiety.

I'm working on making her communicate more with me, but it's tough. 

Also, I'm not going to end our relationship because of her anxiety; it would be selfish because I know she can't control it and feels bad when it happens.

What did you do when you suddenly lost income?,"Hello. I(m27) am looking for ideas what can be done and kind a try to calm down by writing down about what happened. 
So, me and dad make similar money which in sum are about 85%of income but yesterday evening he was voted down from his position of mayor by other party in town council with help of ""his"" people. The thing is that he left the job he had because of how his party got surprisingly 5 of 9 seats and he thought he actually could make our small town (like 2k people) better. Regardless of how it went, our family lost significant part of income and I fear that the job hunt for dad in his 49 years will take longer than those small savings we have will cover.

Why can’t he talk to me when we’re alone?,"Hello,

I have a question. I’ve known this guy for almost two years now. The thing that I’ve noticed during that time is whenever we are completely alone together (ex. In his car) it’s hard for him to keep a conversation going with me. There’s often long silences. It’s like pulling teeth. However, when he is surrounded by at least one of other person he definitely hold a conversation with me—sometimes initiating them. I kind of baffled at this behavior. I know from observation that he doesn’t act like this with his other female friends.

How do I bring up my concerns without seeming clingy or expectant of a future?","Title is tldr. I'm female and my (very few) past relationships were all very green and immature and unhealthy, and I want to figure out the best way to be better.

* we're not exclusive. So it's possible we might even meet new people. I don't really know what to ask here, this part just scares me - I'm really hesitant to let romantic relationships into my life and it's been over a year for me since I last even casually dated somebody.

Is this married coworker just being friendly or interested in me?,"I've been a little confused recently about a coworker[mid-30, M] who have been very friendly with me[22F]. Things check a lot of boxes. How can I tell if he is just being good friends or interested in me? 

[Background]
He is a 30-something male, married but has no kids(and no plans for kids). I am 22 female, a recent college grad, and we work in an engineering field. We recently started talking to each other a lot. It started more like mentoring as he is senior to me in the field and much more knowledgeable in everything. However things got unexpectedly different. I'm kind of new to industry so I'm unsure if what's happening is normal between coworkers who are friends. (If this was in college and with an unmarried person, I'd have concluded that he's interested for sure)

- We started chatting a lot about our personal life and discovering common interests and sharing each of us's interests (like music, books etc) 
- And we did that for hours at the office after everyone else leaves. Until 9pm or even 10pm. (Most of our team members leave between 5 and 6. He seems to be workaholic so he used to stay a little late at work.)
- I was worried if I was interrupting his work too much and taking his time unprofessionally. But he even hinted to talk after regular work hours when he had some news.
- He has made some disparaging comments and showed some disappointment about his current relationship. (Nothing in rude way - some foundational differences between him and his partner in terms of lifestyle)
- Past few days, we'd even chat on our work messenger until like 2am.
- More importantly, he does message me first to say something not related to work. Most surprising one was when he pinged me at around midnight to say how it was a long day and kinda to say goodnight I think, although the conversation continued for an extra hour after he said he's going to bed. 
- This could sound a bit silly... he downloaded an app to share a field of interest with me. You could automatically add all your facebook friends on the app but he only added me. I was a bit surprised by this.


However
- First of all, he's married.
- And we are coworkers.
- I can't compare if he treats me differently than other girls. We don't have other girls in the team. I can never see him interacting with other girls.
- He has acted very very gentle since the beginning where we weren't close - has traditional English gentleman manners. He's very respected by the entire team as well. This somehow makes me feel like he would never take any interest in women other than his wife and would stay loyal. 


I know I would get a lot of criticism for this, but I do feel like I want to get to know him better and spend more time close. I wouldn't say anything clearly over boundries first or act upon my feelings. I'm happy even as it is - having conversations with him and stuff, and don't want to make mistakes and destroy the relationship with him. I respect and admire him, after all.

"Guys, how do you actually win an argument with a woman (or at least defuse one)? I often feel complete outmatched to counter the level of emotion my partners put behind them.","At first I thought maybe it was just the specific women I attract. But I've noticed the trend among friend's partners as well. I know not all women are like this, and I'm sure plenty of guys are the same way...but this isn't something I deal with among my guy friends.

I'm often taken aback at how quickly a calm discussion can devolve into a heated emotion-fueled argument, complete with yelling and tears. And they feel impossible to come out unscathed.

Some of the common trends I've found...

1) My partners are often the first to raise their voice and turn things emotional. Putting me in a defensive position and feeling caught off guard. Once voices are raised, any chance at a productive conversation is out the window...its now becomes all about de-escalating.

2) Any attempts to calm down the situation often make it worse. When I stay calm or tell them to calm down, they just get even angrier and more emotional. If I eventually crack and raise my own voice...they turn to tears, or then telling ME to calm down, making me now the bad guy.

3) They start crying. Once the waterworks starts it essentially completely invalidates my side of the original discussion...as I now have to focus on comforting her.  And regardless if I'm right or wrong, I'm now the asshole for making her cry.

4) They dig up the past. If I made or make a point they can't refute. Or suddenly realize they were wrong midway through them getting upset, they'll often resort to bringing up something that happened the past we've long since moved on from. Then suddenly I feel like I'm having THAT same discussion all over again.

5) They get nasty. This doesn't always occur...but often enough. I see it even among groups of girl friends. Especially if they feel they're on the losing end of the argument or have a weaker point. They'll say something that digs deep. Like a truly evil thing to say they know will hurt me. Which then causes me to get actually mad...and suddenly I'm now the bad guy again.

6) Regardless if they started it all, they expect an apology from me. No matter what happens, I'm the bad guy once they get upset.

Anyway, I know a lot of this is just personal experience., but it just feels like its impossible to come out of this stuff without feeling broken or angry. All I want is calm discussion, and logical diffusion.

How do I not be boring and get a life?,"Sup reddit, imma just spill my life story (it's short) and hope someone can be bothered to help me. I'm 17, with 2 terms until I finish high school and I have no idea how I want to spend the rest of my life. My parents want me to go to uni, but I don't know what I would study. I'm an incredibly boring person; my only hobbies being: working out at home, video games, youtube. I don't even drink or do drugs at parties because the one time I drank people thought I was a creep. Parties in general just feel so empty (even sex with rand girls), conversations I have with friends are just so dull. I've never had a real relationship (ever) because, every time a girl is interested in me, we talk for a while, I get way too attached and needy and they end up friend-zoning me, either because I don't make 'moves' or just because I have no life.

I just need some advice on how to find my purpose in life because at the moment I am not really interested in anything. Also what are some different paths future that I can try out? Also I feel like I should talk to more girls, but I have a reputation at school and work of being the quiet, anti-social kid so idk how to go about that either.

Is it crazy that I’ve been having sex with the same guy with no commitment for almost 6 years ?! And now here I am like a dumbass realizing that I low-key have feelings for this guy.

We’ve had some great nights over the course of years. I’ve been content with our arrangement until the last couple times he’s asked and brought up why we never tried a relationship or asking me am I in love with him.... after the last time which was and extremely intoxicated night we had a conversation that really made me start thinking about how I feel after all this time of never feeling. But he’s a well know dog, so I’ve always had an wall up and standard that I would never set myself  up for failure..... yet here I am after all these years wondering. I’m at a crossroad as to what to do because I KNOW it will never work, I’ve been a secret this long, he dates a certain type of woman. That just my own insecurities playing that part tho. All in all I just don’t believe him cause he’s never shown interest  outside the bedroom. What’s funny though is because we share a mutual friends so when we’re out a group events people always say like you know the chemistry between y’all is crazy low-key having no idea it’s only because he’s breaking my back in... or is that the only reason 😩",AskMen,"Fuck buddies and decoding shitDon’t beat me down to bad guys I just want to hear what y’all think !!!!!

I caught my dad doing drugs. How do I talk to him about it?,"I'm (F, 25) a weed smoker myself so I get the allure of drugs to fill a void where happiness and meaning should be. I'm trying to see my dad's situation through his eyes. He's retired, divorced, lonely and has told me plenty of times that he doesn't want to live. He's not suicidal but he is depressed. He sits on the couch and watches tv all day so I know drugs would help him cope (although it's not a healthy solution). 

I don't know exactly what the drug is. He uses a soda bottle and theres foil on top. He uses a flame. I've known for months but today he actually saw me catch him. I still pretended not to notice because I didn't want him to feel awkward or embarassed. But now that he knows I know, I think it's time to confront him. I hurt for him and want to be there for him but I don't know how. I can't exactly tell him to stop because it's not fair for him to stop for me. At the same time, I'm disappointed and hurt as his daughter. 

I'm asking you guys because maybe you can provide a perspective that I haven't been able to see. Maybe you've faced a similar situation. Maybe youre the father in this situation. 

Please help me figure out how to talk to him about it. I want to be empathetic and loving and supportive. But at the same time I don't want him to get comfortable and start using it more frequently or to do it in front of me now that I know. 

Im considering talking to him about replacing whatever he's taking with something potentially less harmful, like marijuana, and if possible, medicinal.

How can I win over a co-worker I'm attracted to?,"So before I start a little about me is I'm in my late 20's and this girl  I'm attracted to is 3 years younger than me. I was born and raised here  in the states, parents always talked to me in Korean while I was little  so I'd be bilingual when I grew up so I'm very fluent when it comes to  talking, understanding, and reading (basic) Korean, but due to my  anxiety/social anxiety (I always thought that even though I'm fluent in  the language the way I word things out and speak is still like in an  English format so I never thought it was good enough plus I also have  pretty low-mediocre self image of myself and I'm also very self  conscious) . The girl I'm attracted to who I'll refer to as ""A"" was born  in Korea and only came here about a few years ago. Before I came to  this place I went to go seek some help for depression, anxiety, and  possibly ADD, went in got the help and diagnoses I never knew that I had  up until a few years ago and ended up getting anti-depressants and Adderall. I'd rate my anxiety/social anxiety without medication at an 8  and with medications at a 2 or 3 so it's a huge jump. I mention this  because after being there at my new job I'm able to talk to a lot of  people at work in Korean without really being too shy about it, and  that's how me and A communicate with each other.

My  first day at my new job was a very very positive experience in every  aspect (coming from a harder and more demanding job, this job is  MASSIVELY easier and less way stressful than my previous job). So in  this new department I work at it's only pretty much 3 of us and our  Director. Throughout the past few days that I've been there I've been  shadowing A to pick up and learn everything as fast as possible while  also just kinda gazing at her from time to time so it doesn't seem that  obvious. A few moments when I was helping out a few people asked ""Is  that your boyfriend?"" or ""wheres your boyfriend?"" when I was doing my  own thing, she'd reply laughing and jokingly ""yeah that's my boyfriend!""  I'd just kinda give them a very questionable look but deep inside I  know I enjoyed hearing it. When it was time for lunch on my first day I  drove us to the Mcdonald's across the street, I know it doesn't really  mean much and that shes just trying to get to know me better as a friend  a co-worker but she asked ""you have a girlfriend don't you"" I replied  with, ""no I don't"" and then got the question ""why?!"", I really couldn't  answer that question in that quick of moment so I just kinda shrugged ""I  dunno"" and got in my car and that conversation ended there. After I  made my order at Mcdonalds I told her to just make her order and I'll  pay for it but jokingly said ""alright we're friends now"" then she  followed up with ""yeah we are"".

Next  few days that past by nothing really happened much besides me learning  more about what we have to do, her showing me how to do things, and just  us pretty much working together when it comes to other things. It might  have only been a few days but I already feel like our teamwork is  really great and told her to let me know if she ever needs help with  anything.

Do some men act like you aren’t there when they like you?,"I’ve flirted with this guy i work with and he was trying to get my attention during my shift the other day, but then today he walked by like i wasnt even there. I’m wondering if guys sometimes act like theyre too cool for you when they like you or if this is a red flag that he’s possibly a hot-and-cold and therefore abusive person? I really like to feel people out and that is the reason i’m looking into this so much. Thanks",AskMen,"Do some men act like you aren’t there when they like you?I’ve flirted with this guy i work with and he was trying to get my attention during my shift the other day, but then today he walked by like i wasnt even there.

When did you guys start becoming interested in lawns?,"I’ve noticed this summer that I’ve really taken an interest in lawns. Going on a walk in the neighbourhood the other day I noticed a dad sitting out front his garage. Budweiser beside him, white new balances. The dad shorts and everything.

His lawn was perfect. Immaculate. As I walked by I stared at him and told him what a great lawn he had. Easily beat his neighbouring dads beside him

He thanked me for my compliment and then proceeded to put both hands behind his head and lean back in the self-satisfaction that he knows he does a great job.

I should have befriended him, because if he can mow a perfect lawn. I have no doubt in my mind he can bbq some amazing meat.",AskMen,"When did you guys start becoming interested in lawns?I’ve noticed this summer that I’ve really taken an interest in lawns.

Just started a new job and I'm already attracted to my co-worker in my department. Advice for a man who has little dating experience and low-mediocre self-esteem to win a girl over?,"So before I start a little about me is, I'm in my late 20's and this girl I'm attracted to is 3 years younger than me. I was born and raised here in the states, parents always talked to me in Korean while I was little so I'd be bilingual when I grew up so I'm very fluent when it comes to talking, understanding, and reading (basic) Korean, but due to my anxiety/social anxiety (I always thought that even though I'm fluent in the language the way I word things out and speak is still like in an English format so I never thought it was good enough plus I also have pretty low-mediocre self image of myself and I'm also very self conscious) . The girl I'm attracted to who I'll refer to as ""A"" was born in Korea and only came here about a few years ago. Before I came to this place I went to go seek some help for depression, anxiety, and possibly ADD, went in got the help and diagnoses I never knew that I had up until a few years ago and ended up getting anti-depressants and Adderall. I'd rate my anxiety/social anxiety without medication at an 8 and with medications at a 2 or 3 so it's a huge jump. I mention this because after being there at my new job I'm able to talk to a lot of people at work in Korean without really being too shy about it, and that's how me and A communicate with each other.

&amp;#x200B;

My first day at my new job was a very very positive experience in every aspect (coming from a harder and more demanding job, this job is MASSIVELY easier and less way stressful than my previous job). So in this new department I work at it's only pretty much 3 of us and our Director. Throughout the past few days that I've been there I've been shadowing A to pick up and learn everything as fast as possible while also just kinda gazing at her from time to time so it doesn't seem that obvious. A few moments when I was helping out a few people asked ""Is that your boyfriend?"" or ""wheres your boyfriend?"" when I was doing my own thing, she'd reply laughing and jokingly ""yeah that's my boyfriend!"" I'd just kinda give them a very questionable look but deep inside I know I enjoyed hearing it. When it was time for lunch on my first day I drove us to the Mcdonald's across the street, I know it doesn't really mean much and that shes just trying to get to know me better as a friend a co-worker but she asked ""you have a girlfriend don't you"" I replied with, ""no I don't"" and then got the question ""why?!"", I really couldn't answer that question in that quick of moment so I just kinda shrugged ""I dunno"" and got in my car and that conversation ended there. After I made my order at Mcdonalds I told her to just make her order and I'll pay for it but jokingly said ""alright we're friends now"" then she followed up with ""yeah we are"".

 

Next few days that past by nothing really happened much besides me learning more about what we have to do, her showing me how to do things, and just us pretty much working together when it comes to other things. It might have only been a few days but I already feel like our teamwork is really great and told her to let me know if she ever needs help with anything. Whenever we take our lunches now I always just go to Mcdonald's grab another cup of coffee but I texted her after I got in my car and asked her if she wanted anything she texted back ""I have something to eat today. Thanks for asking though (blushing smile emoji) you're nice"" and replied with ""No worries, I got your back :)"" she's always check up on me asking me if I'm doing alright and if i have any questions. I know these aren't really necessarily signs that she might be attracted to me but that's why I'm here, to see if I'm on the right road to something. I've only really dated 3 or 4 girls my whole life, but I somehow feel like there's a connection forming though. Any advice on how I can completely win her over besides the usual ""just tell her how you feel"" sort of thing?

"First time dad experiencing crippling anxiety, not sure what to make of this all. Looking for input.","First time dad here ( 1 week old daughter) she's super healthy and no complications. Amazing girl and no reason to be concerned. C section, so I've been doing a lot of moms stuff on top of my own chores to keep up the house. I do all the cooking, cleaning, laundry and shopping. Trying to do my part. 

A little back story;

Before we conceived, it was discussed that my wife would be stopping birth control and we adopted the ""if it happens it happens"" mindset. My wife was getting into her 30s and was concerned about not being able to have kids. I had my own reservations (we had never been ALL ABOUT having kids) but not wanting a full on confrontation - I rolled with it. 

Throughout pregnancy I started having long bouts of what I assumed was depression and anxiety. Sad for no reason, no appetite, etc. I enjoyed our life as-is but saying that seemed selfish beforehand. 

Not wanting to freak my wife out, I mostly bottled it up and tried my best to put on a happy face. I was frustrated on why I was this way and on the fact I had no one to discuss it with. Obviously I should've seen someone professionally about this (my fault) but again - not wanting to freak my wife out - I did not. She was priority number one. 

I assumed it would all disappear once our daughter was born , but after the magic few days wore off I'm back into my old ways. I feel a strange resentment towards the whole situation, I can't connect mentally and I'm having trouble being empathic with our child.

Would surgical scars put you off when being intimate with your SO?,"I (F22) am not exclusive with anyone right now, but I am talking to someone. They know that I’m mostly inexperienced, but I’m completely open to being with them in that way. What they don’t know is that I’ve had a breast augmentation, two actually.

I was a chubby kid and when I started going through puberty, my chest developed quite fast. The thing is, the shape of my breasts was mildly tuberous (Google if you’re feeling frisky) and while they were very small (34A) they were not perky. I was not happy with them ever in my life. I’ve actually avoided potential acts of intimacy because I did not feel beautiful compared to other women with “normal” chests.

In 2017 I went to a consultation with a plastic surgeon and I had my first surgery booked for early 2018. I had small implants put in with the hopes of filling out and looking average, but I had some complications after healing and needed a second surgery. The second operation fixed both breasts by giving me an anchor breast lift (scar under the breasts and going up to the nipple) and an internal bra (holds them in place). 

Sometimes I do regret getting surgery because of the scars, but if I’m being honest it is a great improvement. The scars are fading quickly and the shape is far better for my body. I’m much more confident in clothes and in my life in general. However, I know this can be off putting to some people.

I want to know what the best course of action for me is over the next 36-40 weeks. I am petrified of this, naturally, but I know with time that it will all get better and it's the instant realisation stage that I'm currently in. 

I'm currently going into in the fall my 2nd Year of my degree and currently work full time this summer in the Sales field to keep me afloat. I will be graduater by June 2021 in a very good degree thankfully so I will be able to support my child fully then, and hopefully the mother as well if things go according to plan (staying positive lol) I live on my own in student accommodation but I know this is not the right place to raise a kid, so next year I will consider further options as I want to be as present as I can be for my kids' sake. I also NEED to finish my degree. 

I just need some advice on the best course of action to adopt over the next period to get me over it. 

I have told my Mum but not as of yet told my Dad. I will let him know within the next few days whenever an opportunity arises to let him know.

I stumbled more or less into that relationship by pure chance and dumb luck. 

Now im looking for one actively but cant find anything at all. That wasn’t my first relationship so i know a bit or two on how to interact with the other side :D...  i study engineering (60-80k starting salary basically guaranteed where i live), work out 4-5 times a week, have multiple hobbies from rescue work, coaching a sport team for minors, woodworking etc. which are to some extent useful for the future and build communication skills, critical thinking, to some degree “parenting abilities”, and a general understanding on how to work with tools and your household to save a ton of money later on... on top of that i work perfectly with girlfriends of friends of mine and any female friends i don’t have any interest in.. 

But for some reason i cant get past the small-talk-phase with potential future partners content wise, after the first 30-60 minutes or so im completely uninterested in them or i get the general vibe that she has zero interest beyond a nice conversation ( which is fine - being nice doesn’t get you laid , but finding a partner for sex on its own isn’t the problem of this post).. is it too much too ask for in a potential partner who shares an interest in building a career / actively contributing to a common household income , values the importance of sport and healthy diet and has more extracurricular activities than YouTube and shopping ? Of Nearly all the conversations i had in the last months my date partners barely “fulfilled” one of those points. Most openly told me they just don’t think that this “stuff” is necessary or should be a requirement for women.

What do men actually consider slim? Very confused,"For context, this question came up when in the same day my boyfriend called me both ""tiny"" and ""thick"". Neither of these things seem to be true, although I'm definitely leaning more towards thick I think. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 5'4"" and 120 lbs (a little lower on a good day, a little higher on a bad day). I have a defined thigh gap, but my thighs are still quite big. There's just somehow still a gap. They are also fairly muscular from workouts. My arms are kind of pathetically fat but I don't think he was talking about these because he was looking at a picture of me with my arms covered when he called me thick. 

&amp;#x200B;

For a lot of my teenage and early adult life I was underweight due to an eating disorder so I basically see my current body as fat. I was thrilled when he first started calling me tiny. But recently he's been commenting on old pictures and saying things like ""You look unhealthy here! I like you better thick!"" and it's striking me the wrong way. Is this a compliment? Is it synonymous with fat? How low does a woman need to be in weight before she's considered properly ""slim""? 

&amp;#x200B;

More context: before posting this I saw a post about thighs/thigh gaps conveniently on the front page and that confused me more. Yes, I have a thigh gap but my thighs are still pretty large and I wear a size 4 (US) in jeans. But some guys said that they no longer enjoy thick legs when they're ""chubby"" and I'm not even sure what qualifies in this case or if mine would be classed here. I also don't even like the idea of being ""attractively chubby"" and I would overall rather be perceived as slim or healthy. What would *that* require? Thank you all for any input.",AskMen,"What do men actually consider slim? Very confusedFor context, this question came up when in the same day my boyfriend called me both ""tiny"" and ""thick"".

Is there a chance that this guy likes me? Should i confess or is it a dumb idea?,"I know this guy for a while now but we never really talked or anything . He started treating me nicely lately and i'm falling for him, the thing is i don't think he is interested but i can't help liking him more and more.

For example: He started to make small talks with me like asking me isn't it hot today? or if i was bored? or where i'm going and stuff.

He started giving me little discounts and i saw people paying for the same thing but he never gave them any.

Today he saw me drinking at a cafe and wanted to pay for my drink but i told him that i already did. Then he offered to buy me another one.

He always smiles when he sees me or talks to me.

So me being the dumb girl i am i started liking him so i went up to him and asked him yo explain something and he started explaining it, i told him i can't understand so he told me to call him later to talk about it. So i got his number.

I did call him and everything and although my gut feeling is telling me that he is just being nice i had a little hope that he would like me back, well he has my number now and never called or texted me, i noticed he talks a lot to people including girls , also today he had to sit in front of me like face to face but never even took a glance at me so i guess these are signs of him not liking me, i know that i sound dumb right now but i need to know why is he being so nice all of a sudden? what could be the reason? should i confess or i would embarrass myself if i did?",AskMen,"Is there a chance that this guy likes me?

Why do some men not leave a woman alone after she expresses she is not interested?,"I (21F) was talking to one of my guy friends about this really great club I went to where they employed dance floor monitors who would make sure men left women alone if they weren’t comfortable dancing with them. I was marveling at the fact that that measure was necessary/the main attraction of the club, and I was wondering why men would approach the same woman over and over when he knows she’s not into it. Wouldn’t you want to dance with or eventually go home with someone who is into you? My theory was that a lot of men would rather be rejected by the same girl several times than be rejected by several different women in one night. Is there any truth to this? 

I get that some people romanticize “persistence”, but when you’re in the club, it’s not like romance is on anyone’s mind. So I feel like there has to be something else that explains this behavior.

TLDR: I don’t get why some men relentlessly hit on the same girl even after she’s rejected him, when they could hit on several different girls and increase their chances of success.",AskMen,"Why do some men not leave a woman alone after she expresses she is not interested?I (21F) was talking to one of my guy friends about this really great club I went to where they employed dance floor monitors who would make sure men left women alone if they weren’t comfortable dancing with them.

&gt;**AITA for confronting my wife about who she masturbated to?**    
&gt;  
&gt;Our group of friends (3 couples) is currently on a beach trip together. We're all staying in the same house. After we arrived on the first day, everybody changed into their swimwear and went into the pool (there's a pool in the resort). My best friend is very fit and he was wearing a speedo. This is not the first time my wife has seen him like this, and I've never noticed anything inappropriate between them. But the moment he arrived she took a glance at him and them became quiet. She also went out of the pool, grabbed her sunglasses and went back in.    
&gt;  
&gt;Later we started playing volleyball inside the pool and at one point he picked her up and threw her over his head, into the water (it wasn't out of nowhere, we were all playing kinda physically, but there were no sexual vibes). After a while she excused herself to go the bathroom in the house. A few moments later I went inside to grab my phone charger from our bedroom and found her masturbating in bed, still in her bikini. She played it off but I found it very odd. My other friend looks like shit and she's never shown any interest in women. I definitely felt she was masturbating to my best friend. I should add that what's bothering me is not the fact she was masturbating and not even very much the fact that she was thinking about my friend. What I found weird and inappropriate was that she had to do it immediately, abandoning a social event to go masturbate like a teenager would. Feels like a not okay level of arousal by interacting with my friend.     
&gt;  
&gt;Some people on reddit told me to let it go, but it wasn't sitting right with me. So last night I confronted her about it.

My (F26) ex boyfriends (M29) who broke up with me a little over a week ago has started texting me. I don’t know what exactly to make of it,"Hey Guys,  

My ex boyfriend who I was with for 7 years broke up with me a little over a week ago. His reasons for the break up were that he felt like his feelings for me weren’t as strong as they once were.  
I didn’t want to break up but since he seemed to have made up his mind, it felt like I had to accept it no matter how hard it was. We had decided to be friends with each other when we’re both comfortable.  
I’m weirdly okay, I wouldn’t say it isn’t hard but I am pulling through.   

I still strongly believe we’d be great together. But for now I need some space from relationships in general. I’ve decided to put focus myself first for the next few months and then see what I think about both of us as a couple again.   

He happened to be in my neighborhood two days ago and we linked up since he will be away for a project for about a year. 

He said that the breakup was harder than he expected even though it was his decision. He said terribly missed me. Ever since then, he’s been texting me every now and then.

My (26) ex boyfriend (29) broke up with me a little over a week ago. He’s been texting me on a daily basis which is confusing me.,"Hey Guys,

My ex boyfriend who I was with for 7 years broke up with me a little over a week ago. His reasons for the break up were that he felt like his feelings for me weren’t as strong as they once were. 
I didn’t want to break up but since he seemed to have made up his mind, it felt like I had to accept it no matter how hard it was. We had decided to be friends with each other when we’re both comfortable. 
I’m weirdly okay, I wouldn’t say it isn’t hard but I am pulling through. I still strongly believe we’d be great together. But I know that I need some space after this relationship. 

He happened to be in my neighborhood two days ago and we linked up. He said that the breakup was harder than he expected even though it was his decision. He said terribly missed me. Ever since then, he’s been texting me every now and then.

"I have the ""6 sixes"", but little/no interest from women","Hello. Here for a bit of troubleshooting, not to complain.

As you read, I have the proverbial ""six sixes"" that today's women look for... Technically, my car is not 600hp, but close enough. 

I'm pretty happy with my life and by no means gunning hard for a relationship. However I feel like I have a huge blind spot in self-awareness, and that's what puzzles me.

I'm not sure why I slip through the cracks with the ladies. When I am out with friends I see women show them signs of interest or put themselves in positions to be approached. I don't pick up any of those vibes in my day-to-day. I also hear stories from male friends and acquaintances about female friends, exes, even strangers striking up chats with them or reaching out to ""check in"" or ""say hi"". The occasional woman seems to fall into most of their lives, even if they aren't overly successful. I don't have any of this going on. My two exes leave me alone, and no contact from any women I knew in high school, college or previous jobs. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm perplexed by the contrast with what I see and hear from other men.

Does anyone else deal with this? I've been out of a relationship for about 2 years and I can only point to a handful of encounters where a woman seemed remotely interested since.

Couple proactive details:
1) I like my alone time and don't spend much time / effort approaching women. Perhaps this is part of the explanation, but I'm also not afraid to go in when a women gives off cues of interest. I have no issues socially in workplace or with friends. Perhaps a bit reserved but never been too shy to flirt when there's mutual interest.
2) I doubt that it has to do with ugliness. I've been called hot by few women in my life, but more often told I'm handsome or nice looking. I'm 6'1"", college athlete who stays in shape. I'm in late 20s. My take is I'm not model status, but certainly acceptable.
3) I am not really on social media. No Instagram, Snapchat, or twitter. I have a Facebook that I check a couple times a month. I respond to messages / comments but don't post.
4) I don't go over the top, but wear good clothes, have a nice watch, etc. Style is outdoorsy but nice... North face / mountain hardwear / Patagonia / Nike / etc. All kept in good shape.
5) Self sufficient, living near a major city, earning multiple six figures, saving 70%+ of income, but treating myself to a nice life.

My request is to comment with anything I might be missing. My biggest hang-up with red pill doctrine is that the evidence in my life does not support some of the things I hear.

Example: ""women just want a successful guy to lock down as they get older."" 
I completely agree with the narrative, but I'm successful in the material sense and certainly don't have any women chasing me around, ha!

Creepy guy won’t leave my girlfriend alone,"Hey guys, so first of all not sure if this is the right place to post this but maybe some of you have dealt with a situation like this before so I’m going to give it a go. 

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 7/8 month at this point and on our first date this guy came up to her asked her how she was doing they had a weird exchange for about 15 seconds then he went on about his night. After he left she explained to me that he had been messaging her nonstop since 2017 (they apparently got a drink one night and then she stopped talking to him) she had him blocked on everything at this point.  Sorta creepy 

Shortly after that night (about a month or so) he realized he couldn’t get a hold of her and managed to get her email and start EMAILING her saying he knows it’ll work out if she would hangout with him etc... idk can’t get the picture I guess. 

So months go by, a few days ago my girlfriend had someone place an order for all her products in her online store sending them to a random consignment shop... look at the email address... it’s the same guy. 

She’s threatened to get a restraining order on this guy and he hasn’t really stopped, he’s been apologetic in a way saying he’s sorry for “disrespecting her relationship and isn’t intending on doing that” but still won’t stop messaging. Who knows if he’s still messaging her considering he’s blocked on everything we wouldn’t know. I’m hoping someone on here has dealt with a situation similar to this and can maybe help me out. I for one see this person as a dangerous individual with some sort of mental problem and I obviously don’t want anything to happen to my girlfriend nor would I want someone trying to talk to my girlfriend all the time in general lol. I know where he and his family works I’ve thought about going in there and telling his parents maybe even confronting him directly, what’s the best way to get this psycho to stop harassing her. As far as the order goes I told her to refund it, I TOTALLY get wanting to keep the money but it was like 150 bucks and it feels like that’s just being complicit with someone’s agenda “yeah she won’t talk to me but maybe she’ll take my money” type of vibe... could’ve been the wrong move but who knows.

how to mentally deal with small bumps/pimples/cysts on penis?,"hi guys, i'd love some advice on this. 

i'm 27. basically, i occasionally get some bumps on my penis or around it. i had 2 removed throughout last year, even though the doc told me it was nothing. i occasionally still get them. sometimes they go away by themselves, other times not. now i have 2 cysts, 1 on the scrotum touching my thigh, and the other just on the beginning of the shaft. i already went to the doctor, and she told me again it was nothing and sent me away. in addition i have a small pimple on the shaft. i get those sometimes as well, which i was also told by the doctor to not worry. I'm never sure if i should press out the pus or not, as sometimes it does go away, and sometimes it just appears to become bigger. 

now that i am regularly having sex, even though the doctor told me it's ok and should not worry, i'm way to embarrassed about it and it definitely keeps me out mentally. i just think that she'll eventually feel it/see it but won't say anything, which will make things even more awkward.

Deeply depressed 22M. Can you guys give me some advice and though love to get of my hole ?,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a deeply depressed 22 year old male. I'm deeply sorry to bother you with my problems in this sunny day... But I'm desesperatly seeking some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

One year ago, I've had a very troublesome relationship that put me in a light depression. To get out of that first hole, I was seeking new experiences and I wanted to train muay-thai (my favorite sport) in Thailand, where my older brother (30M) lives. Things didn't go as planned.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my brother pushed me to sleep with prostitutes, even though I said I didn't want to before coming there. The whole trip was around that, basically. I had to stay multiple time at the appartement to not go to ""dirty places"". The girlfriend of my brother asked him multiple time if I was gay because I didn't want to reiterate the experience. Even my brother tried multiple times to make me ""fall"" again. According to him,sleeping with prostitutes was a ""quick way to personnal developpement"".

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried multiple things to get ""out of my hole"". Hypnotherapy, meditation, sport, therapy (seen more than 5+ therapist), antidepressant. Nothing really works. I still feel dirty, weak, humiliated,  hypocritical to my values. I don't know what to really do anymore, I'm seriously considering suicide and I have already a plan for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it's pretty funny, because everything apart from that is going fine in my life. I have multiples friends. I meet success in my field of engineering, and I'm gonna be published in a scientific journal for my studies during an internship and work in space robotics that year (on the ""next curiosity"" robot). Surprisingly, even though if I'm socially ankward, I've meet multiples wonderfull girls. I didn't had a proper relationship with them because I fear intimacy right now ( and I don't think going into a relationship in my current state of mind would be a great thing), I quite enjoyed my time with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel... Weak, humiliated, dishonored. Even more, I feel just... pathetic to have a depression for that. I mean, a lot of peoples have it worse than me on a lot of level and are still level-headed. But, I can't help myself... I still feel... Bad, stupid, weak. Like if my past was stained in black, which again is ridiculous logically speaking. But even though I can understand the situation on a ""logical level"",  I'm still feeling like trash.

My friend gets all the girls.,"Hello, first time poster here.  
In a small group buddies that we hang out together, there is this one guy (we will call him Garry) that manages to infatuate every single girl that becomes close friends with us. And he's not even that great of a guy. Garry is usually passed off as an ass due to his constant criticism of everything, that teases and makes jokes at the girl's expense. He is also brutally honest, always telling a girl straight up if he finds something they wear as ""horrible"" or ""disgusting"".  

He doesn't even ask them out. First relationship that he got into, a friend of Terry wanted to get chummy with a certain female. Female straight out told to his friend that he wanted Garry instead.  (they had a bad breakup though, because of how he treated her)

Second relationship, and also the first girl that got close to our group's cycle, was a gal that he was constantly making fun of. But apparently bullying the heck out of another person makes them love you, because she became infatuated with his wit. For real life reasons tho, they had to split.

Next girl that we meet, a genuinely good person and all-around caring girl that has a boyfriend of 2 years who is extremely chill and introverted. But guess with who she loves to hang out the most out of our group. Garry. Because yet again, wit, teasing/bullying, and black humor. 

FOURTH girl that our group meets, the little sister of one of our buddies. She instantly falls for Garry, and for 2 months, that's all who she thinks about. This time at least, she starts talking with one of our other guys in the group, and now they are in a lovely, wholesome relationship with each other.

Note that all the women referenced here, are generally introverted people who are into books, shows, etc. so it strucks me as even wierder that they prefer this type of personality and treatment.

I don't blame Garry in any way. It is me who has a personal gripe with how every female that we meet and get close with, seems to have him as their primary choice, every time. He isn't even the kind of person to ask a person how their day is going. He just wants to have as much fun as possible, with the least cost possible. And I am a bit biased myself, because I sense a lack of respect from him towards me, in how he treats me when we talk (drops attention easily, cuts me off, ignores me at times when there's a person who he's more interested into at the time. usually a girl.)  


This feels more of an ""off my chest"" thing honestly. I have my own things to work with, but every guy in my group has some charm points.

How to be more assertive and stand up for myself,"Hello fellas of reddit. Pretty much as it says in the title. I'm about as non-confrontational as humanly possible, and it annoys me. Also think it makes me a target for people to try and use, and so on. 

For context, I'm pretty sure I know where it comes from. grew up in a very unstable household where aggression was far more commonplace than it should be, and far too vehement when it arrived. Haven't experienced levels of rage quite like it elsewhere in my life tbh, and I'm 24 now. Apparently that kind of household regularly sends people one of two ways, either to have a complete aversion to aggression, or to have anger issues themselves. I was the former. Probably to a small extent a natural inclination of mine as well that was greatly exacerbated by that situation.

It's got to the point where I don't actually feel anger anymore, which doesn't help me stand up for myself if I feel I've been wronged. I just repress it. Or at least I assume that's what happens because everyone should feel anger as a normal human reaction, and there have been plenty of things that I would say I have every right to feel angry about. Growing up I'd freak out in my room and punch walls and so on like a classic edgy teenager, but then pull myself together after venting and wade into the shitshow and try to break things up and calm everyone down. After long enough though, I started not experiencing the freaking out in isolation bit. I just didn't get angry anymore. 

Whilst I try not to beat myself up too much about it, given the origins of it, it does bother me. And I think will possibly prevent me from being a success, in work and in relationships (both romantic and platonic) and so on. I don't want my childhood to define me as a person, and think being more assertive and being better equipped to handle disputes that will inevitably pop up throughout life would be a massive boost to my life. Not looking to be needlessly aggressive or to feel the need to assert my dominance over everyone who has the misfortune of being near me at any given time haha. I do however want to at least be able to hold my own in an argument if I feel I'm in the right, without crumbling and going back to old habits of trying to diffuse the situation by any means possible, including backing down.

What do you guys think about this new music video Mattiel - Je Ne Me Connais Pas?,"So I on the road at an intersection to turn left on a blinking yellow. I was waiting for the car in the oncoming traffic side to go because his light turned green and I have to wait for him to go before I can turn left over his lane. The light's green and this guy is just sitting in a hopped up 4x4 doing fuck knows what. I wait for this guy and he's not moving so I take my left turn and this prick slams the gas and honks his horn driving straight at me. Fucking idiot.

Anyways here's the link to the music video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsEEKkHOq_g 

Looks like a new artistic take on the old guys are pigs thing, wondering what you think of it. Know any guys like that? Independent, smokes, drinks, cocky, likes women. The title and also the chorus means ""I don't know myself"" in french. What do you think about this lambaste the artist's directing at their ex or some guy? About how he doesn't know himself. I feel like he dumped her or she wouldn't be mad enough to make a video about it, or maybe she got the inspiration elsewhere.

Seems like a lot of people ""don't know themselves"", men and women. There's tons of people that go through life living ""unexamined lives"" or go through it trying to distract themselves.

How do I truly move on from my ex?,"I had my first breakup around 1 and a half years ago and I went on this sub to search for advice on moving on, I knew back then I still miss her but I didn't want to be that crazy ex everyone complains about. We broke up due to long-distance, she had reached out to me a few times, I responded to them a few times, we chatted for a while, hooked up once, yet the feelings became stale when she went back for her studies. I decided to ignore her once and for all. I distracted myself from her, from my feelings, picked up new hobbies, hang out with my friends, focus on my studies. Yet sometimes when I'm alone in my room, where the exams are over and there's nothing for me to worry about. I think of her, giving me the feeling that all those stuff I did had no effect on helping me to move on.  
She came back this summer to visit, I missed her yet I resisted my urge to contact her, I hung out with the guys a lot. But recently, through some mutual friends who chatted with me a few days ago and told me that she has a new boyfriend now. And I think I'm back to square 1, like all the progress I made was all gone and I feel immense amounts of guilt on ignoring her as we could possibly get back together. Is it normal to feel this way? Are my ways of moving on correct? Or is this just me being jealous.

Uncomfortable with girlfriend inviting her flirty boss to our private engagement party.

From guys that went from no social life to hookups and then relationship. How did you grow past casual? And how did you grow your actual social life?,"Hey guys, I'll try to keep it short.

Basically I was a very lonely kids (parents didn't let me leave house, couldn't go to parties, spent all time in library).

Only started getting normal friends at 14/15, was unable to talk to girls and since High-school (alongside the pickup videos everywhere, forgive me for my sins) all my focus was on getting girls, for better and worse ( thanking puberty and more recently) I can't complain in terms of casual sex.

But thing is, it's getting boring, I'm 21 in college and I only bother to go on tinder every month when the need gets too strong. 

My relationships even with friends feel shallow because I've never really learned to hanging out in groups and I always seem to go to my safe loneliness.

And girl wise, I feel fascinated by a few girls, mostly very intellectual that I'm talking to about Camus and stuff, but I either ""put them on the pedestal"" (haven't written this in years but kinda matches the situation) or simply get stuck into the deep conversations and go to strong too fast.

How to deal with a republican?,"I do airbnb. Our guest are usually very decent, but I have a crazy one, tbh he its the worst guest we've ever had (out of over 200) but not for the reasons you think.

The man is a Fox News parrot. He is also super religious. He is young (36), a hispanic immigrant, and ex military. I think he is extremely stupid and uneducated and a fucking cunt. But these are his greatest hits:

1. 75% of back single mothers are on welfare
2. Black people enjoy victimhood
3. White males are being destroyed and need help and programs to survive
4. White males are being destroyed by feminists.
5. Dr. Jordan Peterson is right about everything, he destroys people.
6. It not my beliefs I'm trying to impose, its the word of God. And yes he is a HE definitely.
7. Affirmative action is racist
8. These refugees are fake refugees.
9. if Trump continues with his policies I'll vote for him again.
10. Evolution is unproven and creationism is proven?1?

And this is just today, I finally told him that I could no longer talk to him because he was an absolutist and I couldn't be bothered anymore. I try to hide from the guy but even the most innocuous conversations as I go to grab a pint of milk from the fridge always end up with him arguing his Fox News talking points in my house and I'm honestly offended as fuck. 

He hasn't had one original thought.

The only reason he's still here is his wife who appears to be a very long suffering young girl is here and I feel sorry for her. I am very open person exspecially to politics but I have met my match in this dude. I seriously want to make a new house rule to not talk about anything other than the weather, I have never met such a disagreeable and ignorant fellow. 

I don't even have a question, just wanted to vent. I dont think there's even a way when they are this rabid and ignorant."
How often do you guys moisturise your face?,I’m a 20 year old and I’ve never really moisturised my face.

Am I really gay? I can’t believe I’m asking this,"I’ve never done stuff with guys ever. I had a girlfriend for a long time but it seemed like she was never happy. Things came to a head about 2 months ago. She was always wanting me to eat her pussy and I tried it a couple of times but was always grossed out so I decided I just wasn’t going to do it any more. I’ve tried it with other girls and...ugh.

Anyway, we got into a fight about it. Apparently, she had never been happy with me in the sex department. I said “Well, I’ve never been happy with it either but what does that have to do with anything?” She brought up the gay thing. She said she thought I was and I needed to figure it out.

And I was like, I have done every fucking thing that’s been expected of me. I went to the right school, I got the right job, I had a girlfriend. The pussy thing is the one thing I refused to do. And now everything is falling apart.

I’ve always looked at male porn. In high school, I watched stuff with girls, too, but I just wasn’t into it. I never thought much about it. Never told anyone. No one ever accused me of being gay.

So she ended up breaking up with me. And now I’m thinking “holy shit.” Could I really be gay? I feel like I can’t ask gay guys because of course they’ll say I am. I have barely left my house in like 2 months. I keep freaking out that somehow somebody will figure it out. I thought that maybe I could just find a woman who maybe didn’t expect much sex but the more I think about it, the more the prospect of going through all that fills me with dread.

Do you think I’m gay? I can’t believe I’m asking this. What do I do? What will people think? I feel incapable of managing life at this point. Why did she have to ruin everything with her demands?

How do I approach friends after a toxic relationship?,"I just got out of a relationship that could only be described as toxic. She basically convinced me that my friends were the reasons why I drank, and why I was ‘immature.’  Regardless of the relationship, I cut out my friends of almost 10 years in order to make her happy.

How to overcome severe post-nut syndrome?,"Literally the moment I bust a nut I go from ""I think I love you"" to ""get out of my apartment"". I'll be talking to a girl and really connect with her, but the moment we have sex I just don't want her anymore. This past weekend I hooked up with a girl I'd been talking to for a while and she wanted to cuddle after sex and I could only handle it for like 2 minutes before I told her to leave. She said okay, but I could see her fighting back tears and that really hit me. I've read about post-nut syndrome, but how can I go from really liking a girl on an emotional level to not wanting to even see her after having sex. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'll be talking to a girl and really connect with her, but the moment we have sex I just don't want her anymore. This past weekend I hooked up with a girl I'd been talking to for a while and she wanted to cuddle after sex and I could only handle it for like 2 minutes before I told her to leave. She said okay, but I could see her fighting back tears and that really hit me. I've read about post-nut syndrome, but how can I go from really liking a girl on an emotional level to not wanting to even see her after having sex.

Help me find out whats on my boyfriend body please?,"We have  been together for a year, we have sex pretty much every day I still have my suspicions.. please don't judge me this question because this has been going on for a while I know he's cheating but I'm trying to find proof just so I can leave him..

The other day he showered alone even though we always shower together mama then next day while he was in the bathroom I saw he has a friction burn or some kind of burn on the side of his hip where the V shape muscles are.

It wasn't just a spot of that it also had something above it aligned and it also had some fingerlooking long lines in the back with a cracked heels are.

I asked him what that was and he said he didn't know, well recently he tells me that's my friction when I am on top of him with my legs, but today I noticed those are literally fingers bruises on the side of his crack Hills.

Now I'm starting to think first I thought it was friction my legs but there's fingerprints and there's another scratch looking thing on top of the burn from the the shape of the muscle so..... 

what does it look like to you? I'm just trying to find some proof in order for my mentality to understand that he sees other people because right now my gut tells me he sees other people but I have no proof.

How do you handle strong raw physical attraction to someone you also can’t stand?,"So a quick background. We work together in a relatively big collective for 4 years now. She’s 10 years older than me and for first 3 years refused to totally acknowledge my existence. We would work night shifts when it’s just me and two other nurses often sitting in a small room together and she would never speak to me or even say hi back when I did. When she had to speak to me it felt like I was some kind of a dog for her. I eventually just shrugged it off as some weird childish behavior and went on with my life. 

Now recently I noticed she’s much friendlier with me. At first it was a joke now and then and now she pretty much goes after when she needs help and whenever I go to the clinic (I also work on ER but have all my civil stuff upstairs at the clinic so I often run up to grab something) she’s the first one to notice me and start joking around. Once she asked me what kind of a underwear I wear and honestly I’m not all right in the head so I jokingly said pink panties. Since then she regularly asks if I have them on. But that’s just to give you a general idea of everything. Now she also is or isn’t in a relationship with a guy I know. No one is really sure because he worked with us for some time and everyone who knows him also knows he isn’t into relationships that much. On top of that when me and her played cards at night (it was a calm night at work had some time to chillout) I asked about him and she just said that he’s a dick and that the relationship is “on hold”. Since than during these nights we talk she often mentions how unlucky she’s in love and how she’ll never find the right guy etc. All of this is super weird after she wouldn’t even talk to me for years but there’s also this weird tension between us. The seductive looks and stuff and I could swear it was all just my imagination until today my good friend and coworker seriously asked if I noticed how she’s flirting with me and overall too “friendly” these weeks. 

Now here’s what I keep thinking about. I’m not some kind of a r/ihavesex badass but I never had trouble finding a girl at least for a one night stand. Also I don’t get attached or super attracted fast but with all this going on I keep feeling this raw physical attraction. I’m sure it’s just physical and thank god I’m switching workplaces quite soon but this is new for me. On one hand I still see her as that bitchy woman who wouldn’t even talk to me and if so than with a crap ton of arrogance and on the other hand I there’s this raw physical attraction.

Y'all, he came throooough! I brought things up one more time the night I made the post (by having him take the mojo upgrade quiz), and then kind of left it and didn't say much, because as he said ""I wasn't at all surprised by the results, we've talked about all this before.""

So it wasn't really an issue of me needing to explain things more, so much as give him time. 

Things got hot and heavy yesterday. I was stressed out of my mind and in addition to calming me down with food and cuddles, he slowly massaged everything and successfully turned me into a little quivering pile of goo, then amped me up and fucked my brains out. It was glorious. Then he did it again before bed, and in the middle of the night. It was amazing. 

So long story short, I did communicate a lot, and pretty clearly, I just need to be waaaay more patient and less pushy. (...which is 90% of my issues with everything in life lol. Im not a patient person.) 

He might not come around to *all* the kinky shit I'm into, but last night we definitely had a lot of fun ;)

Is there an experience where your employer casually implies they prefer male workers versus women?,"Before anyone gets up in arms about discrimination, I may not really be talking about careers more so just jobs “anyone” can get; part-time, minimum wage, etc. 

I’ve had women bosses tell me in the past that they prefer male workers. Not even because of drama but more so about how much women get sort of that free pass sometimes where they don’t want to/feel like doing something and someone else will always take over or do it for them. I think some employers have experience with asking women to do something outside of their “job description” and women will put up more of a fight about doing it. They may say certain things like they don’t get paid enough, or that’s not their job (which again, is anecdotal evidence and the reason I’m asking)  I think this sort of ties in to the difference in gender upbringings and why women can feel more discriminated sometimes. Obviously we’re not saying this is something specifically limited to women but I think this is why women get the wrong idea about how being “bitchy &amp; bossy” is a bad thing for women. I think it’s because they do it at the wrong times. Instead of just doing what is asked and complaining about later to someone, they will just flat out refuse to do it and sort of make a big deal about it until someone else (man or woman) will suck it up and just do it to get the dust to settle.

To me it seems that if you have the thought of competing in something in the back of your mind, it changes your attitude about life because you then have a goal to work towards, which seems nice because I often feel like I'm just going through the monotony of life every day and nothing to look forward to. That's not to say that I'm depressed or anything, I've just become apathetic towards most things.

My parents dislike my girlfriend immensely for no reason. How do I handle it?,"I’ve been with her for over a year and I love her. Doesn’t mean there is marriage anytime soon or anything but I enjoy spending time with her, she cares about me, etc. 

But my parents, who don’t even really know her, just keep talking shit about her. I brought up that I want to bring her to Thanksgiving and my mom starts absolutely lecturing me about how she doesn’t like her and hasn’t envisioned me with someone like her, etc. 

I love my parents and I love my girlfriend and while the relationship is obviously not perfect, with either my girlfriend or parents, I just wish I could somehow change their minds. Because she’s a great person and while she may not be a model or anything, I love her personality and how she makes me feel when we aren’t arguing. I just don’t want to have to choose between everyone obviously because should it get a bit more serious, I know my parents would stage an intervention regardless of how I feel to try and subtly manipulate me.

How do You be Genuinely Yourself in a Cutthroat World?,"By most stretches of the imagination, I'm just a normal [26/M]. I have a big tech job, a good livelihood, I live in an urban area, and I eat well. I'm friendly, knowledgeable, and do my best to be thoughtful and supportive. I work out and maintain healthy habits - I'm actually a muscular and bulky guy who people are commonly intimidated by. I've always been a very independent person, mostly out of necessity. But I'm also a very sensitive person, and was notoriously shy and skittish as a child. Now, I'm still quiet, but I know how to be jovial and outgoing and enjoy being a source of entertainment.

My primary concern at this juncture is that I *think* I've been doing all I can to live this cultural narrative that I need to be tough, strong, and confident at all times, especially to attract the highest quality people into my life. Unfortunately, this has actually never actually worked. I'm not the leader type, I'm not aggressive, sure, or confident, and I probably project all sorts of insecurity as a result of trying to be like that. Despite my hyper-masculine appearance, I'm actually the most harmless and sentimental person you may ever come across. Little things affect me a lot. I live a rich and emotional existence, almost entirely alone.

In very few social situations am I able to feel like I'm being genuinely myself. I constantly catch myself projecting a version of me that doesn't really exist. This includes in dating. I do a lot of projecting early on, which statistically works really well at attracting and holding someone's interest, but it's *exhausting*. I quickly become totally burned out and decide to quit the relationship, upset at myself that either I couldn't present my true colors, or that there was an obvious and large incompatibility that I overlooked for the fun of sexual intimacy (which has been an elusive and mostly absent part of my life). It probably doesn't help that my only actual dating opportunities have come from the online dating, which is generally a soul-crushing venture in my experience.

It's hard to convey in words what I'm actually feeling, but it is a complicated mixture of shame, failure, and inadequacy in what I see as a reaction to a seemingly cutthroat, testosterone-y, aggressive world to which I don't actually belong but actively try to participate in. **Are there any other self-ascribed highly-sensitive men who have overcome feelings like this in their past that can shed some light on what I need to do to feel more genuine and achieve the relationships I want and need?** I am making progress in feeling more authentic, but the relationships are NOT coming along with that progress.

Would surgical scars on someone’s body scare you away?,"V personal question ahead!! Thank you :)

I (21F) had a breast lift and reduction done because yeah my tits were uneven and huge for my body frame so they were also saggy. I was never insecure about my boobs before the surgery tbh but it just got annoying not being able to wear backless clothes or having to tape the shit out of my titties to make them presentable in the clothes I liked. Because of the surgery, I’m left with two scars that run under each boob (like a semicircle on the underside of each one, following the curve). I’m wondering if this will terrify some guys and how I could go about explaining it without seeming super unattractive. How bad would the scarring need to be for you to NOPE out of it?

Why would a guy say rude things to a woman he's trying to sleep with?,"Awhile back I went on a few dates with an older guy who was looking for a casual arrangement. I lost interest for several reasons, but one of them was that the whole time we were hanging out, I don't think he once gave me what sounded like a genuine compliment. He \*did\* say some weird/borderline rude stuff though. 

For example, the first time we got together he asked me if I was straight or gay (this was after I'd flirted with him at a party). When he asked me my age (almost 28 at the time) he said ""oh, so you're pushing 30 then."" At a later date, he told me I was ""a smart chicken"" but also that I was ""awkward in an endearing way."" During our 3 dates he never complimented my appearance at all, except once when I was sort of fishing for it (I called him cute, then he acted insulted (perhaps jokingly) that I used that word instead of a more manly one I guess, then I said no one ever called me cute, and then he said I was but didn't sound very enthusiastic about it.) 

The whole time we were on these hangouts he was dropping lots of obvious hints that he was looking for sex though, along with talking a lot about himself in general. Around the time I stopped responding to his messages I was feeling like either he was just never that into me, or else he was trying to act like some kind of macho poser or something and thought his attitude would make me want him more. On the whole I found it a turnoff and just plain bizarre.

How do I enjoy my time by myself and not rely on other people for entertainment?,"Preface: I'm a college freshman (but gap year, so ~19.5), and I posted this on /r/college as well.

I have no roommate, and basically just hang out with my neighbor a ton. I have a bunch of other friends, but they're either too busy to hang, or we have conflicting schedules, or we're just not good enough friends to hang outside of our shared activities.

I've found myself ridiculously bored when I'm on my own (which I've been for the past few hours, prompting this post). I find that I'm basically just relying on my neighbor and activities when I want to do stuff, and the rest of the time I'm just passing time online or doing nothing.

I know the general advice would be to branch out, find new people, start new activities, but that's not the solution to my issue -- I'm alright with having only one close friend, I'm pretty busy with activities as is, the issue is that I'm incapable of enjoying time alone, and I don't think that's healthy.

I don't want to need other people around me to enjoy myself, but that's basically what I've been like for a while. When I'm on my own, I'm usually just waiting until other people are around, and that's wholly unsustainable.

Three weeks ago I met a guy (yeah, from tinder) in a town about an hour away, we had a drink in a bar, then went back to his place. The conversation in the car on the way there was more than just chit chat. We really seemed to be touching on deeper issues and we seemed to truly enjoy one another’s company. The sex was fantastic and we really talked afterwards too. I had to leave, so he drove me back to my car. We talked about my open marriage and my feelings about it and about monogamy in general. Good stuff. 

We texted some dirty talk the next week and he asks when I’m free to hang out again and what I want to do.   He even says he’d come to me and we could actually DO stuff in town together, not just fuck. I go over to his place the next Friday and it’s nice to see him again. He says this is not his typical hookup, as he actually missed me that week and, yeah, I missed him as well! I say this is a bit confusing, but it’s lovely to be cared about. I see delight in his face as I say that I missed him too. He touches my face and strokes my hair and we hold hands. 

More great sex occurred, spurred on by these mutual admissions that we care about one another on some level. I break my hard-and-fast open marriage rule and stay with him that night, sleep in his bed while I tell my husband I’m staying in a hotel since I’m too tired and tipsy to drive the hour home. He even snuggles up to me in bed. It’s kinda sweet. He says next morning that he’s glad I stayed over. And I was too. 

Next day, I have to go home. I send him an Amazon Prime bedsheet since I stained one of his, and he says it’s thoughtful and sweet. We don’t chat much, and if we do, it’s only about sex, and what he wants me to do to him or for him. 

I’d like to have this occur again, so in my mind I’m waiting for my schedule to come out so I can let him know when I’m free. But when I mention it, he puts me off. “I’ll have to let you know my schedule,” or “I’m actually pretty busy today” instead of him asking me when I want to hang out. 

I couldn’t figure out what had happened : had I come on too strong and was now appearing needy? We talked a lot at first and now he’s apparently ready to be done with this? Did I scare him off by being intense? I miss him and think about him a lot. I had hoped it might indicate that he wanted to hang out more with me.... but instead of this morass of not-knowing, I removed him on Snapchat so I don’t ever have to deal with him. 

Was this the wrong move? I’d like to see if we could actually have a relationship and now I feel like I’ve somehow messed it up without knowing how.",AskMen,"Was I too needy?Dear Men,

How Do You Move On From Devastation?," I could really use some advice. These nights are very long and hard.

This could be long, so bare with me.

**The Background:**  I had been dating a 4th year medical student for the past year. We  began the relationship knowing at the end of the year she would  relocate, but we clicked really well, so we kept it going anyway. By the  end of the 4th year, she found out she was relocating across the  country and invited me to go with her. The move for her was about  starting her career with people she liked in a place that she loved. The  move for me meant being with the person I loved in a place I could  love, but it also meant I would be giving up my job, home, stability,  friends, etc. I knew the risks, but I loved her, so I was willing to do  it. We got an apartment together and relocated across the country to  build a life.

**The Past Three Months:**  Her life began to blossom. She was getting into the groove at the  hospital, she was becoming close with her co-residents, and she enjoyed  the things the city had to offer. My life seemed to get darker. I felt  nervous to leave the apartment. I felt embarrassed to be unemployed. I  kept applying but only kept getting rejections. The only social  opportunities were ones that she initiated, (going out with other  doctors mainly, seeing parts of the city, day trips to go hiking). It  created a situation where I hated being social because I felt like a  loser around the successful and high powered people. I hated going out  and spending money I had no right to spend if I wanted to survive. I  felt like I had no life of my own, and who would want to be with someone  with nothing going on for themselves. It created a very vicious mental  cycle. I couldn't enjoy anything, and a few times I tried to explain  that, but I never seemed to be able to communicate it very well.

I  was stand-offish often, and there were times where I acted like a real  ass, but I tried to make day to day life with her good. I cleaned the  apartment, made sure the place was stocked with her favorite snacks, and  we shared a lot of good, small moments together. We didn't get into  very many arguments, and maybe that's the problem.

**The Ending:**  Several days went by where things felt off. On some level I registered  that something was wrong, but I was terrified that it was wrong with us.  I didn't bring it up, therefore my anxiety grew, therefore my  standoffish-ness grew. On Sunday night, she came into my room and while  crying explained how miserable she had been. I knew things were not in a  good place, but I had no idea they were that bad for her. She never  told me about the effect of the events of the past 3 months until this  breakup conversation. The reason she offered was that she had thought  about it a lot and came to the conclusion that we wanted different  things out of life. I felt something inside me break, and I just went  numb. I almost passed out to be honest. She gathered some things and  went to stay at a co-resident's place for the night. I think she was  willing to do that until I found some other place to live within the  city.

**The Aftermath:**  She ended things, and I had no job to support myself. I had nobody else  who cared I existed there. I didn't want to stay in that apartment and  wallow. I didn't want to be in that city anymore. My best friend was  2400 miles away, and I needed to get somewhere where someone knew me and  I knew them. So within 24 hours I packed up all that I owned into my  car, and I left. I drove across the country in 3 days, rarely stopping  for food or breaks. I saw some of the most beautiful country I've ever  laid my eyes on, and I've seen some of the most barren and destitute  country you could think of. I stayed in 2 motels with no wi-fi, and no  hot water. There were a lot of very dark moments on that trip, and it  was easy to think of ways out that nobody would be suspicious of. Every  waking hours my brain was busy analyzing every moment, decision, and  sign in the relationship. I felt like I was being tortured by my own  mind. However, after 35 hours and 2400 miles, I made it.

**Closing:**  I used to over analyze a trip to the grocery store, but I just drove  across the country in 3 days by myself. My perceptions are broken. My  ability to think and trust my thoughts and judgement is gone. My heart  is broken, and my life is a mess. However, the world has not yet ended.  I'm still alive, and I feel like the only option I have is to endure. How will anything ever feel good again?",AskMen,"How Do You Move On From Devastation? I could really use some advice.

Why do I have the mental desire for sex but not the physical desire?,"TLDR: mentally I have the strong desire to tag tail but when tail falls in my lap I’d rather just rub one out and go about my day cause it just does nothing for me. 

I’m 24 and like any other male I have testosterone and the itch to rail any attractive woman. I can think about it and we can talk about it but as soon as she’s over and ready to be beef stroked I lose all desire. I’ll go ahead and dick her down but it just doesn’t scratch the itch like I was hoping it would. I’ll be aroused and all but I have no performance or stamina or be truly turned on. These women are attractive and aren’t bad in bed by any means but any time I really think about hitting one up or going out to bring one home I’d rather just rub one out cause that cures the itch more than actually getting laid does. Every weekend I’ll do it and get the same result and spend the next week wondering why I even did it. Then the weekend rolls around and I’ll think it was just a fluke, let’s try this again, and no surprise there it was the same as last weekend. 
I’m not trying to sound like a hoe by any means either. I’ve slept with 7 women in my life but damn I’d like to get laid and enjoy it. I rarely watch porn and occasionally rub one out so it’s not like that’s ruined my perception or anything.",AskMen,"Why do I have the mental desire for sex but not the physical desire?TLDR: mentally I have the strong desire to tag tail but when tail falls in my lap I’d rather just rub one out and go about my day cause it just does nothing for me.

"Do all your girlfriends/wives get emotional and cry and whine and get angry over the weirdest things, or just the ones I seem to attract?","Hi everyone,

I (29M) grew up in a very stable, calm, quiet family situation (and am very thankful for it). My mom and sister never seemed to get super crazy emotional over weird things. They were always very calm and rational people. (My dad was too, for what it's worth). We are pretty much a family of introverted, logical, positive people.

Cut to my dating life the past few years. The handful of girls I have been dating do NOT fit that description. I understand the concept of PMS and hormones and how they affect women. But it's still really hard for me to get used to these emotions, given the family dynamic I grew up in. In fact, it can make me really uncomfortable when a woman I am dating is crying about how we just don't ever feel that connected and then an hour later seems just fine and looks at me like I'm crazy if I ask how they are doing or if they are OK.

I guess my question is, is this par for the course? Are pretty much all women like this? Do your girlfriends/wives come out of nowhere saying the strangest possible things and exhibiting the strangest possible emotions? Does it feel like a roller coaster sometimes? Is this just a matter of me needing to get used to these sort of things and accept them? Or is this not typical behavior, and I've just gotten unlucky in the string of women I've been dating the past few years? IF this behavior is normal and it really is just on me to adapt to the crazy world of a woman's roller coaster of emotions, how on earth can I do that and stay sane?

Y’all ever feel like total losers when Friday night rolls around and you don’t have any plans?,"I live alone, I’m single.... and I’m spending Friday night getting carry-out and playing video games. 

It’s not like I don’t have have friends, I do, I swear! I normally hang out with them all the time! Football games, bars, DnD, parties, you name it!

But the last couple weeks they’ve all been busy. Hanging out with SOs, working, spending time with other friends, etc. And this weekend is rolling around and the only thing I’ve got going on is a friend’s birthday happy hour tomorrow afternoon.

Are guys afraid of getting STDs?,"I (female) am in my mid 20s and I have been noticing how many guys I sleep with do not carry condoms with them and will not automatically put a condom on unless I ask them to. Many of these guys are one night stands. They don’t ask if I’m clean or ask if I’ve been tested recently, and they still don’t want to use a condom. I am clean but I’ve recently started telling guys I’ve never been tested and have no idea whether I’m clean or not so that it’s a risk for them and they still say they are okay without using a condom. Half the guys don’t even ask if I’m on birth control! I am always wary and questionable of new people I sleep with and always use a condom until we’ve been tested together and just don’t understand how so many guys can be so not afraid of getting an std or even of getting me pregnant.

Need help understanding what happened last night," I (M24) went on a date last night with a girl (F26) I met at school. She and I met towards the beginning of the semester, and she ended up contacting me via my work e-mail (I work for my campus). She sent me her number in the email. A couple of weeks pass, and I end up mustering the courage to ask her out on a date. Last night was the date. We ended up hanging out at a bar, and getting slightly drunk. I offered her to walk her home, and she accepted. We've been clicking incredibly well up to that point, having a blast overall. We kissed a few times in the bar. Anyways, we got to her home and she invited me in, saying that we ""most likely won't end up having sex tonight"". We ended up having sex and I spent the night (for the record, we had sobered up a bit by that point, and she was the one who initiated). The sex was amazing. I told her that. I also told her I was having a ton of fun, and that the night was a blast, and that I'd be willing to do this again soon. She said she felt the same. We also opened up to each other about past shitty relationships. We finished the night with her reading me her favorite poem. Jump to the morning: she seemed a bit distant. She *did* have to get ready for work, and she was pretty tired from the night before, but I am still worried that she ended up regretting the night. Overall, she seemed less sentimental and tender. I feel conflicted: I don't want to move into anything too quickly, but I did really enjoy hanging out with this person. I'm worried about what her mannerisms may indicate. Any insights or advice?

What is the craziest thing you have personally witnessed at a sporting event?,"I used to be a vendor at a couple sports stadiums in a major city and have seen some crazy things over the years and I was just wondering if you guys had any stories that stick out in your mind?

I personally witnessed an unsuspecting guy stand up and buy his entire section a beer and then a hotdog. His bill was thousands of dollars and he didn't even bat an eye. I was a hotdog vendor that day so my personal tab with him was around $700. He gave me a $100 tip, I couldn't believe it. 

I also once personally caught a foul ball with my hotdog metal hotbox, which I thought was awesome until they made me pay around $300 for the damaged hotbox when I turned it in that night. 

Kind of off topic from my origional question but another fun thing that I remember is one year the teams bus was being loaded just outside the locker room located next to the gift shop I was working at and all the rookies came out of the locker room in full drag. Apparently this is an annual tradition they have at the start of the series away before halloween, and you better believe my coworkers and I took pictures with them.

Turning a relationship into a FWB,"Or perhaps I never had a relationship in the first place?

Met a girl on Tinder. We clicked. Went out for a few months. Best person I have ever gone out with. Outgoing (hard to find at my age), attractive, great sex. I am mid-40s, divorced, no kids. She is in her early 40s. We both joke how way more attractive than people our age (it's true :))

We just hit a silly rough patch. No one did anything wrong, it just happened. At one point she asked if I just thought she was a casual relationship. Makes it sound like she wants more. She said she wanted a break (she is emotional, haha), I said I did not want to be friends. Relationship or bust. After two weeks, we went out like nothing happened. Made out, but no sleepover since it was a school night. She went ahead a made plans to see me on Saturday night.

When I tried to ""win"" her over during the middle of the two weeks, I said all we did was drink and have sex. Never went out for brunch! And here we are with another drinking date. 

Since I met her on Tinder, I get to see her location. I can see the distance change to her work. Never checked while we were dating, only now.

Sorry for the length, now onto the questions!

Was I ever more than a FwB?

She is great in bed. I have always been a relationship person. Had some ONS in my 20s, but because they happened, not from being a player. Should I just continue for have sex with her? Theot  part that gets me the most is the sloppy seconds nature of such a relationship. What is she up to tonight? I am jerking off and she is getting screwed by some other guy?

How Do I Move Forward After Being Dumped 3 Months After Moving Across The Country?,"I've posted this in r/BreakUps, but I wanted more perspectives. Here is my story:

 It's a little long, so bare with me.

**The Background:**  I had been dating a 4th year medical student for the past year. We  began the relationship knowing at the end of the year she would  relocate, but we clicked really well, so we kept it going anyway. By the  end of the 4th year, she found out she was relocating across the  country and invited me to go with her. The move for her was about  starting her career with people she liked in a place that she loved. The  move for me meant being with the person I loved in a place I could  love, but it also meant I would be giving up my job, home, stability,  friends, etc. I knew the risks, but I loved her, so I was willing to do  it. We got an apartment together and relocated across the country to  build a life.

**The Past Three Months:**  Her life began to blossom. She was getting into the groove at the  hospital, she was becoming close with her co-residents, and she enjoyed  the things the city had to offer. My life seemed to get darker. I felt  nervous to leave the apartment. I felt embarrassed to be unemployed. I  kept applying but only kept getting rejections. The only social  opportunities were ones that she initiated, (going out with other  doctors mainly, seeing parts of the city, day trips to go hiking). It  created a situation where I hated being social because I felt like a  loser around the successful and high powered people. I hated going out  and spending money I had no right to spend if I wanted to survive. I  felt like I had no life of my own, and who would want to be with someone  with nothing going on for themselves. It created a very vicious mental  cycle. I couldn't enjoy anything, and a few times I tried to explain  that, but I never seemed to be able to communicate it very well.

I  was stand-offish often, and there were times where I acted like a real  ass, but I tried to make day to day life with her good. I cleaned the  apartment, made sure the place was stocked with her favorite snacks, and  we shared a lot of good, small moments together. We didn't get into  very many arguments, and maybe that's the problem.

**The Ending:**  Several days went by where things felt off. On some level I registered  that something was wrong, but I was terrified that it was wrong with us.  I didn't bring it up, therefore my anxiety grew, therefore my  standoffish-ness grew. On Sunday night, she came into my room and while  crying explained how miserable she had been. I knew things were not in a  good place, but I had no idea they were that bad for her. She never  told me about the effect of the events of the past 3 months until this  breakup conversation. The reason she offered was that she had thought  about it a lot and came to the conclusion that we wanted different  things out of life. I felt something inside me break, and I just went  numb. I almost passed out to be honest. She gathered some things and  went to stay at a co-resident's place for the night. I think she was  willing to do that until I found some other place to live within the  city.

**The Aftermath:**  She ended things, and I had no job to support myself. I had nobody else  who cared I existed there. I didn't want to stay in that apartment and  wallow. I didn't want to be in that city anymore. My best friend was  2400 miles away, and I needed to get somewhere where someone knew me and  I knew them. So within 24 hours I packed up all that I owned into my  car, and I left. I drove across the country in 3 days, rarely stopping  for food or breaks. I saw some of the most beautiful country I've ever  laid my eyes on, and I've seen some of the most barren and destitute  country you could think of. I stayed in 2 motels with no wi-fi, and no  hot water. There were a lot of very dark moments on that trip, and it  was easy to think of ways out that nobody would be suspicious of. Every  waking hours my brain was busy analyzing every moment, decision, and  sign in the relationship. I felt like I was being tortured by my own  mind. However, after 35 hours and 2400 miles, I made it.

**Closing:**  I used to over analyze a trip to the grocery store, but I just drove  across the country in 3 days by myself. My perceptions are broken. My  ability to think and trust my thoughts and judgement is gone. My heart  is broken, and my life is a mess. However, the world has not yet ended.  I'm still alive, and I feel like the only option I have is to endure.

I realize I should have considered how he would have felt, but I didn't think about it because I'm stupid thinking it was okay to do that since my friend was gay. I know it was wrong of me because I overstepped boundaries. What do I do? I already apologized and tried explaining, but he just keeps shutting me out."

How can I help a friend who struggles (consistently) in relationships?,"I have a friend who is a wonderful dude. He got his heart broken pretty badly when he was about 22, he was in a 7 year relationship and she broke up with him. He was convinced they were going to get married.

Since then he’s been trying to get into another long term relationship, desperately. He’s really quick to get feelings for girls he’s friends with, and his level of intensity scares them away. He wants to get married before he’s 30, he’s 26 and rushing to find something. He always buys them expensive gifts and that makes them feel uncomfortable, and they always send him nice messages to say they’re not ready for relationships. They’re all nice girls. Other than his intensity he really is a good guy, not in a ‘nice guy’ kind of way. 

My dude won’t accept that he needs to take things slow. He considers any failed attempt a “waste of time”. I honestly think if he just chilled, even started something casual with someone it would turn into a relationship. But I can’t get through to him and it’s making him miserable. Any guys been in similar shoes? How did you break out of it how did your friends help you to do that?

How much do you and your SO discuss your days after getting home?,"I feel like I will recap funny stories, and discuss big or unusual happenings, but generally I don’t value the tedium of day-to-day work enough to warrant talking about it. My partner however will go into very specific details about their day, who they talked to and what they did, backstories of clients they see, and so on. I don’t want to be rude... I love talking with them about stuff, but when I feel like it’s less substantive or just talking to talk I get disinterested. Moreover, I feel like there is a large difference between our lines of work, and both of us are specialized in our own ways, so I partly feel compelled to not talk about work because it would be hard to explain contextually, and in return I sometimes find it difficult to understand what my partner is describing in terms of their work.

How do you cope with the news of your dogs life-span shortening and their inevitable death?,"So, yeah...My 6 year old lab was diagnosed with Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia/heart disease on Wednesday. While it's not an immediate death sentence the vet said it could shorten his lifespan to a single year or if we're lucky he could life a ""normal"" life and get a few more good years in. 

 Since the news I've been in a constant cycle of catastrophic thinking (I struggle with OCD/hypochondria) and scouring the internet for advice and stories of dogs with TVD living long lives. I hate to admit it, but it's even hard for me to look at him because I cannot help but think of losing him. I can't stop playing the day I lose him over-and-over in my head - taking him to the vet, having to make \*that decision\*, seeing his dead body, saying goodbye and seeing him one last time before being cremated. I just can't shake these horrible thoughts. He's just such an incredible dog and deserves so much more.

I know he can't live forever, but I just imagined him growing old beside me and hoping he lives to at least 12 or so. I had hoped I'd have a child that would one day meet him. He's my first dog ever. He's really my child and we have an incredibly deep bond- he comes to work with me everyday and we do just about everything together. He's got me through a horrible break-up after a 6 year LTR engagement ended.

I think I may get another dog. For him to have a friend and enrich his life and selfishly so I wont have to be alone.

I'm going to do everything I can to continue to give him a great life. He doesn't know of his condition and he doesn't think about morality. I suppose this is all for me.",AskMen,"How do you cope with the news of your dogs life-span shortening and their inevitable death?So, yeah...My 6 year old lab was diagnosed with Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia/heart disease on Wednesday.

"Frustrated w GF, want her to be happy","TLDR: how do I make my girlfriend feel less stressed about partaking in a hobby that brings me a lot of happiness?

First some background. We met by happenstance. We are very similar and even enjoy playing video games a lot. I used to work a lot when I first moved to this town, like 80+hour weeks for the first year or so (hit 118hrs one week, go overtime pay). Met her, decided I want to take this a little more seriously with her and not let other things become a priority over her. 

Naturally we really took to playing games together. Asked her if she'd like a really fancy gaming chair like mine and a bigger desk to share with me and all. So I've spent a LOT of money getting this setup for us. 

As the weeks have gone on, she hasn't sat down to game with me very often despite many numerous requests for her to join me and my friends online. 

After many attempts to ask her to play with me I start asking why she is so hesitant. Turns out she thinks I'm a little too serious and aggressive online. Shes afraid she will make a wrong move and be judged. She says she needs to play these games on her own so she doesn't have the fear of making a wrong move and being judged. But shes mostly afraid of how I'll act if shes messes up, shes heard me get frustrated with my friends when they do something in a ""serious"" game and doesn't want to risk having that happen to her. The thing is I dont see myself the way she does. I dont slam my fists, I dont yell or if I do its not very often and not due to anger, though there was one instance where a griefer random teammate was killing our team and I got pissed at the guy. But most of the time my friends and I just play the game and have fun, if we are screwing up too much and getting rocked we switch to a less stressful game and mellow out. She equated the stress she felt when playing with me to handling deadly poisonous snakes for the first time (she used to do that IRL)
 
Because I used to work so much, I didn't have time to go out during the week or on the weekends, I stayed home, did laundry and cooked and dishes all while chatting with long time friends who, like me, moved all over the US. It's the only way we stay in touch besides the occasional text. I play video games with my friends because I miss my friends. Without video games, I sadly dont have very many friends in this new town. I always have had a small circle, so the 3 or 4 friends in this town I do have are all I feel I need, but I also dont want to cut video games out because that means detaching myself from people I've grown up with and known my whole life, and somehow they make it work with their spouses and such. Granted non play with them that I've seen.
We go out pretty often and play pool or hang out with friends, went to the aquarium last weekend. So it's not like this is the ONLY thing I want to do. 

But this is something that I really enjoy doing and it keeps me close to old friends. I want to make her apart of something that makes me happy, because she makes me happy and I want her to be happy too, and get to know my friends. I just dont know what to do. I dont want to stress her out, she has plenty of that with her job (her boss is a total dick, and a sexist asshole) and I want her to look forward to coming home and playing a couple hours of games with people who look forward to seeing you online.",AskWomen,"Frustrated w GF, want her to be happyTLDR: how do I make my girlfriend feel less stressed about partaking in a hobby that brings me a lot of happiness?

How should I ask my mom about an OB/GYN appointment?,"I was reading articles online and they recommended that girls should see an OB/GYN when they're 13-15 years old or when they first start having sexual intercourse, whichever comes first.

Boyfriend wants a threesome -- what do I do?,"Posting here because my /askmen post keeps getting deleted

Bit of background:  we are both 50'ish.  We've not been together long.  I think our sex is fantastic.  He likes hearing about my past threesome encounters (MMF) which I think is a bit odd, but whatever...it's just talk.

He has mentioned SEVERAL times that he wants another man to join us.   He says that he wants others to ""see what he is getting"".  I reply that GETTING what ""he is getting"" should be enough.  Yes, I've had threesomes, but that was decades ago and I'm a different person, sexually and mentally, then I was back then.  

I fear that if I do this, I'm opening a door that can't be closed.  I don't want to be with a third.  I've had very few lovers the last 10 years of my life and, in my mind, I just want to be with him.  I can't comprehend why he'd want to see me be with someone else, but I do want to make him happy.  I just fear this won't be a one time thing.  

But if this is a deal breaker, meaning that we are sexually incompatible, then I don't know what to do.  I enjoy being with him.  So, I guess I'm just looking for some insight:  Why would a man want to see another man fuck his girlfiend, who he claims to ""love""?  Will this request ever go away?

Best Friends to Roommates with Different Standards of Living,"Hello! I’ll try to keep this short while also giving enough of the story, just looking for some advice from people who are more experienced than me. 

I have been friends with another girl for about 5 years now, we met online and this week is the first time we have met in person. Over the past 2-3 years (ish) we have occasionally brought up moving in to an apartment/house together. 

These past 4 days have been overall really good! I love the majority of her family and we get along decently well. There are a few comments about appearance and the size difference (most of the time it’s jokes and that’s something I’ve been meaning to work on anyway so it’s okay) but I’m pretty happy with how it’s working out. 

Now her family isn’t millionaire rich, but compared to the way I grew up it’s... a lot more. I do want to live in a nice place, don’t get me wrong, and I’m really happy it’s working out and that they have those things. But since I will be the main income provider there are limited things I can provide. She is used to having a lot of amenities that I’m not sure I can afford all at the same time. When we look at houses what seems like a mansion to me is a dump to her, and I hate to be a disappointment. 

She is my best friend and I do want more than a lot for this to work out. My main question is is there anyone who has gone through something similar and had it work out? I really don’t want to lose her as she is my best friend and I have a year to make it work out, so will definitely be saving! 

Also as someone who grew up very sheltered, is it easier to “make it” than I have been led to believe? I am not the biggest saver in the world but I have lived on my own before for 9 months. (Renting a room and discount grocery/dollar menus. Plus a lot of free YouTube lol) There have to be ways to make it work, maybe I’m just hoping for reassurance or advice on things to keep my attention on? I’m not really sure it’s just got me starting to worry about losing her as a friend or not being able to pay for things.

Opportunity or oppression ?,"I've lived alone as a nomad my entire life, traveling and essentially putting my head down wherever I find myself, .. think of it kind of like being a traveling journalist/adventurer and you'll have the basic idea of it.

Maybe it's true that ""the grass is always greener"", but lately I've been considering that it might be nice to have some kind of creature comfort, maybe something like an actual ""home"", where there is food, a warm bed, that kind of thing, that I could go to sometimes .. and I'm starting to think about how that could be done.

It's a challenge because I've literally never lived in a ""home"", so I don't know the first thing about it, and I also don't have time to do the things that I want, I just want the benefit of them.  So I want meals being made, dusting, .. basic housewife kind of things, like being married in the 1950's, .. except I am not the least bit interested in romance or being ""married"", that's simply not something I want.

I don't even know how to describe the ""relationship"", since you could think of it as being married except without being married, or an employer/employee kind of ""live in housekeeper"" or ""long term caregiver"" or whatever, or even think of it almost like being family, except that I am particular and like things the way that I like them, so i would be the head of it.

So my question, is this the kind of thing that a woman (it could be a man too, I suppose, but for some reason I imagine it as being a woman), would consider an opportunity ?  Or is that kind of thing just so outside the norm now that it is only seen as a kind of oppression ?

What she thinks????,"My classmate,  .  A charming beautiful girl and she's attractive at first sight to any guy. Everything was great and I thought her to be normal girl. But soon I found her committed with some random guy at college. After a month she again got along with another guy.

Dealing with vaginal irritation due to multiple kinds of semen?,"Hello! Question for vagina owners out there who deal with semen from multiple men. I’ve got two sexual partners and they both cum inside of me. Everyone is clean and I’m on birth control, so no worries there.

"Visited My Best Friend, Left Depressed [Advice]","Hey there, ladies!
  
I could really use some girl advice right now.
  
I made a friend in a writing community over a year ago and we became super close. Talked every day, FaceTimed a bunch, and she became my best friend. We both had vacation days to use and we decided to finally meet up and have a fun vacation together.
  
The first few red flags was when it didn’t seem like she was as excited for me to go as I was. I asked a bunch on numerous occasions if she still felt comfortable with me flying to spend time with her, and didn’t put any pressure on her if she didn’t. (I just wanted to make other plans since I bought plane tickets if not) she insisted she did.
  
Then comes the big day! We are excited to finally meet but the first time we do, i didn’t feel any of the excitement from her side. I brushed it off as being tired from traveling and a bit too sensitive.
  
Then the days kept rolling on. We hardly talked, and I kept feeling like a burden and not wanted there. We would go to places together and she wouldn’t even stick around- would venture off without me. I kept feeling horrible but tried to brush it off. I’m just being sensitive, that’s all.
  
Dinner one night, we got to a place she loves and whilst talking, she makes the joke that I should leave. After feeling so horrible, naturally the joke doesn’t land. I try to keep it off my face but I ended up crying in her car soon after. We were on our way to a show and I asked if we could still go because I didn’t want to ruin the night, but when e stood in line, it was clear she was overwhelmed and extremely anxious. I dragged her out of line and I found a bench for us to talk about. She cried that how silent I was being after I cried made her feel insecure and that I wasn’t going to be friends with her. I reassured her and we went back to the show.
  
But nothing changed. The next day came and we spent an entire day in her home not talking. It was like I wasn’t even there. I was so emotionally drained I went to where I was sleeping and cried. I guess she heard me and I told her I wanted to talk. I told her how I was feeling and she reassured me that she did want me there. But I couldn’t shake how I was feeling. She also kept calling me a “writing partner” instead of a friend, and when I confronted her, she said that we were close friends (when I consider her a best friend). It just rubbed in the wound and I eventually asked after awhile if I could get some sleep. I decided my expectations were wrong and would readjust them for the remainder of the trip.
  
The night before my last day, there was no mention of me leaving. No sadness, no “I’m going to miss you”, or dreading I’m leaving. Nothing. It was very strange. Then the morning of, there was nothing either, but when we got to the airport, she finally showed emotion and cried as she said goodbye. It’s been a few days that I’ve been back and there’s still been no mention of me being gone. No missing me or anything... which feels odd given how close we have been.

Is there a self-improvement community for women?,"There is a rapid growing self-improvement community on Youtube and certain parts of Reddit. It concentrates a lot on classical stoic philosophy and teaches to refuse porn and masturbation, wake up very early, read a lot, and more esoteric things like cold showers, sleeping without a pillow, and a weird worship of Friedrich Nietzche's ideal of a superhuman. A lot of them appear like conspiracy theorists and suggest that the elite are plotting to make them weak, addicted to instant gratification, and lazy. 
I notice that there are only a handful of female channels on this topic, and are mostly religion-motivated. Is there a female community that concentrates on similar matters of physical, mental, and esoteric self-improvement?

Have any of you been accused of being “too instense?”,"I have been accused of being too intense pretty much since high school (twenty-five years ago).

Asked old teacher on a date. She said yes. Is it a date date?,"Ladies, I either just hit the jackpot of many young lads highschool fantasies, or I'm about to walk into a situation with the totally wrong idea, and make an ass of myself...

Here's the scoop. I went to an 'adult learning' school for dropouts, when I was 21. I'm 30 now. Met this GORGEOUS teacher who wasn't much older than me I'd guess (maybe she's 40, I'd guess currently? I never asked but she seemed roughly a decade older. Gorgeous, slim, tattooed, very alternative.

Fast forward to now. Pulled a crazy move and hit her up on FB as we had talked once before, years prior, and she still shows up in my FB messenger 'active' people. She's super friendly about the message, asks if I'm still pursuing goals in the subject of school she taught me, (writing) etc.

Then, I asked her, and I quote, ""I also wanted to know, honestly if you were seeing anyone? I visit the city pretty often, a lot of events, concerts, etc. Was thinking maybe next time I'm in the area, in a few weeks, maybe we could grab a drink or something?""

Her reply was, ""Just split with someone about a month back. Sure thing. Let me know. I’d love to catch up!""

We talked a little more and agreed to grab a drink and then hit a concert I've got a spare ticket for, in a month's time.

Is this whole 'Nice Guy' thing exaggerated?,"Greetings women! I am a guy I would really like your honest opinion on this matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you're all aware of the saying ""Nice Guys Finish Last"" and the common belief that women prefer 'bad guys' over 'nice guys' (for romantic partners) and that 'nice guys' get dumped into the friend zone. I really don't buy these beliefs and would love to hear the female perspective on this...

&amp;#x200B;

**Consider the following guy:**

He's nice with everyone. He always greets others with a smile and has great etiquette and smiles. He respects women and views them as his equals in all regards. However, he does NOT feel that this 'nice' nature of his makes him entitled to romantic reciprocation. It's just the way he is and he is 'nice' without the expectations of any return. Moreover, he is also confident in himself, in his personality, in his career, in his body, and in his hobbies and lifestyle. He loves socializing but he also loves living out his own life to achieve the goals that he has set for himself. He approaches women that he likes (romantically) and respects their decision, even if they reject him. he has a lot of female friends and does not feel any need to 'hit on' all of them. Yes, there are some female friends that he 'likes' and would like to eventually approach them for asking them out on a date. If they say yes, that's great. If no, he would still like to be friends.. He is not a 'testosterone junky' and doesn't feel the need to flaunt his aggressiveness and dominance everywhere he goes. He is a calm man and confident in his silence.

How to get over my “break up” with my high school best friend?,"From the ages of 11 to 16 I had this friend, we’ll call her Anna, who was my BEST FRIEND. We were attached at the hip practically. I went over to her house all the time, stayed for dinner most weekends, always together. She was my soul sister. 

A year or so after we met, in 7th grade, I kind of just knew Anna was gay. And in the back of my mind I was excited for her to come out and be comfortable with who she was. But I, of course, never brought it up. Our sophomore year of high school, after exam day, we were napping in her room when Anna planted one on me. I now know I’m bisexual but I didn’t then. But anyway I was excited by the kiss but also it scared me because I had a boyfriend at the time and I panicked. Afterwards, I said I wanted to talk about it and she said “what? It was bound to happen anyway.” We never talked about it after that and carried on as usual. 

Towards the end of sophomore year, I could sense our friendship deteriorating. We would talk for hours after school every day to her dodging my calls or saying she was busy. She started hanging out with this other group of girls in my grade (catholic all girls school, graduating class of 29), and wasn’t really available anymore and when I asked if something was wrong she’d say no. One day, I don’t know why I did this and I know it was wrong, but I tried to anonymously ask her a question through her tumblr page that basically would get her to admit that she was gay. And forgetting she was kind of a techie, I didn’t think she’d be able to know it was me. But she did. And I remember her response post on her page saying “it’s come to my attention that someone tried using my inbox to get me to admit personal information about myself. I feel extremely violated”, etc. it carried on. I felt really bad after that. I didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t my right or my place to try and pry that out of her because even if she was my best friend, I wasn’t entitled to know EVERYTHING. I cringe thinking about it now. 

I never got to apologize before summer break and when we came back she had cut her hair really short and changed her style and stayed with that other group of friends. What ensued was her and this other girl bullying me relentless for a two years to the point where I almost dropped out of high school. They spread rumors about me, saying that I was a slut and that I had slept with this senior girl’s boyfriend (I definitely had not. I was pretty geeky and awkward in high school and didn’t even know a boy tbh). It got around to the teachers and nobody would look at me. I spent lunches eating in empty classrooms or taking walks outside to get away from everyone. Anna and the other girls were from the wealthiest families at our school and thus their financial leverage made them untouchable. (Sadly at most private schools it’s only how much money you have that gets you noticed). 

Anna would later go on to tell our principle that I told her to commit suicide (I did NOT). Anna was my best friend at one point. I loved her still. 

I tried confronting her one day and she just pushed past me. 

It’s been 7 years since we were friends. The worst part for me is that to this day, I have very vivid dreams of her. It’s always me telling her how much I miss her and how I miss being her friend. In every dream we’re always friends again. I dream about her 3-4 times a month. It bothers me so much because I feel like I can’t escape the memory. It sounds crazy I know. 

I recently found her on LinkedIn (she blocked me in high school on everything so this was the only way) and messaged her. I kept it short and sweet and simply said that I regretted how things went down and that I was sorry for hurting her. I told her I hoped she was well and still keeping up with her dream of writing a novel. 

I never heard back. We seem like extremely different people now and like we wouldn’t be friends now. But idk. I strangely still inexplicably miss her despite how horribly she and that other girl bullied me, to the point where I was cutting my arms out of depression and grief.

Do you consider it cheating if happens on a lucid dream?,"This question has been insipred by an episode of Black Mirror.
Let's say your partner is dreaming and they are aware of it, they can control what happens in the dream and their decisions aren't determined by the dream's reality (especially because in a lucid dream you basically bend reality into whatever you want). Your partner then decides to have sex with another person, fully knowing that ""in real life"" they're with you. How would you feel about it? Does it matter if the person they sleep with is close to you both, like a friend? What if it's their celebrity crush?

Was this consensual or am I just stupid??,"Okay so look. I just recently had sex for the first time as an 18yr old woman. I was very excited and joyed to have had sex. I shared this information with some people at my job that I work with Bc we are a “family” like establishment and (again) I was very excited and felt the need to tell people. (Bad choice, yes Ik)
SO there is this one particular co worker which I hadn’t been close to but we were always cool. Jokes and laughs and whatnot’s, nothing flirty nothing serious. In the past before all of this he wanted to talk to me by asking for my number. He’s way older than me w child so No I was not attracted/interested in him. ofc I told him I wasn’t interested. We continued to be cool as stated above. I want to let it be known that I wasn’t the person to tell him I recently just had sex for the first time. It was another co worker.
It becomes topic of the fucking day. And he (along w others)  won’t stop making misogynistic jokes. I become frustrated and even a little pissed off but since they were “joking” I was expected to just laugh along w them.
Anyways fast forward a couple weeks and I’m working with this same co worker. Me, him, and a few other co workers were all discussing relationships and sex. I was inquiring about some advice in regards to how I should go about certain things. All of sudden he starts bragging on how good he gives head. Blah blah blah. One then asks me if I ever received head before. To which I responded no Bc I hadn’t. So he (as well as the manager on duty ) insists he be the first person to give me head Bc he Bc was so good. 
Yes it was good yes it was consensual. He even told me “we don’t have to do this if you don’t want to”
Next shift we worked together he asked if I wanted head again after work. Ofc I said yes. HOWEVER as we are walking to my car he asks “ so what all we about to do?” I say “the same thing as last time” which was get some head and go home. 
Second time around I was very unimpressed and uncomfortable (no I didn’t cum). I believe I was not enjoying myself because I was not attracted to him in any way, shape, or form. (I called it experimenting.) anyways the act is coming to an end and I begin to raise up to start putting on my bottoms and he goes “what are doing” I’m clearly confused so I look at him like “wtf you mean “ 
I don’t remember much after that. All I remember is him unbuckling his pants and e whipping his d*ck out. as I watched this before my eyes I felt as though I was in shock. Next thing Ik I was having very uncomfortable, unenjoyable, disgusting, non pleasurable sex. I drove home in turmoil. 
Since then I haven’t been able to put a tampon inside. I go back and forth with myself trying to figure out if it’s my fault Bc I didn’t say verbally say “no” or “stop” or “I don’t want to do this” but never agreed to it either. All in all I kind of hate myself for allowing this to happen to me.

How do women feel about Robert Pattinson’s looks?,"Very weird question I have. Please stick with me, haha.

I serve weddings, banquets, etc. Lately, it seems about every other shift, I have people commenting how I look “exactly like Robert Pattinson.” Keep in mind I didn’t even know what he looked like (since he did that twilight series when I was 10).

At first I shrugged it off. But literally EVERYONE in their right mind kept telling me I looked like him...

... so one day I finally looked him up and yes, I’ll admit, it’s uncanny. Even my hairstyle is exactly the same as his. Lips, jaw, smile. We also have the same height, 5 o’clock shadow. It’s almost as if we were separated at birth (even though I’m 19 and he’s 30 something).

Anyhow, here is my question:

- women, how attractive is he to you/what is his reputation?

- if you think he doesn’t look good/have good style (hair, etc), do you think I should switch it up? I haven’t switched my hair style in years.

I’m usually not super self conscious, but lately I’ve been messing with different hairstyles trying to not look like him as stupid as that sounds, just to raid off “you look like him” comments (again, don’t know if it’s good or bad).

At least he’s the next batman!",AskWomen,"How do women feel about Robert Pattinson’s looks?Very weird question I have. Please stick with me, haha.

"First visit to the OBGYN, single father","Hey folks, this is probably done to death but I'd appreciate anyone who chimes in. I'm youngest of 3 boys and I'm a bit lost on some aspects of raising a girl. My 12yo had her first menstrual cycle a few months back.

If a woman makes a reaching effort to touch you in conversation does that mean they are trying to convey a message?,"Allow me to explain a little bit more. 

There's this co-worker I am a little smitten with. I also have a bad history in misinterpreting female attention, so usually I just don't go out of my way to interact with women. 

But this woman, even when I walk by her and ignore her, seems to make an effort to say hello. From far away I always catch her following me with her eyes, tho I know this doesn't really mean anything. 

The defining moment was when I came in on my day off and bought something. This is retail, so she was up at the registers. I walked to a register and didn't really make an effort to get her attention. She seemed busy. But our eyes caught in the checkout cam.

So get this. She approaches and says hey. We start talking and she asks me how I'm doing and gives me an arm touch on the shoulder. But this arm touch required her to reach and stretch a bit to do. In addition her hand took the shape ones hand takes when they are sprinkling spices over a classy steak. You know, that fingers pinched together action. 

I must sound like an insane person, but I am reading into this really hard. It's been five years since I've been in a relationship and against my fear of getting hurt and the what-ifs I'm actually thinking about asking if she wants to chill sometime. 

I just need to know what the damn arm touch meant. I mean, aren't women usually careful about giving attention to men? Wouldn't want the guy you were trying to be nice to thinking that you're into him, right?

How to get over the pressure of a “life timeline”?,"I’ve always had a timeline for my life, and I’m sure many women do. There are certain societal expectations that make it very difficult for me to ignore. As a result, I feel like I’m rushing through life, anxious to get to the next step “in time.”

I’ll be specific:

I’m 26. I just bought my first house with my boyfriend, despite family pressure (mostly from his side) to get engaged/get married. We decided to save all of our money and buy/renovate our dream home and put off a wedding (which run $25k+ seemingly at minimum where I live—my friends’ extremely average weddings both cost $40,000+).

However, now that we bought the house and JUST started renovations, I’m feeling the panic creep up. We always said we’d give ourselves a year to do the reno before we move in because we don’t want to take out loans (we live at home and no one is kicking us out). But now that it’s here I’m like, “Oh god, that means I’ll be almost 28. Then we have to plan a wedding which means I’ll be at least 29 when I get married. And then what, I have to pop out a kid right away to meet my goal of 30?”

It’s silly. All because I don’t want to be an “old” mom and I’m scared of potential fertility issues, etc etc. Which I guess are valid concerns, but still. I want to just enjoy my NOW. What we just did is a big deal, and it feels like I’m ignoring it because I’m constantly focused on the next thing on my checklist.

Is this girl interested and should I do anything?,"I met this girl in a school related group around the middle of last year. I went back a couple of times mostly for a chance to get to talk to her one on one. It never really happened. We've had very slight interactions, and it seems like she'll always make some very short comment to me if nothing else. I stopped going to the group because a certain person there made me uncomfortable, and I don't want to go back because of them.

I know where this girl works, and I'm thinking about going in there one day to talk to her and to see where it goes. But I question if that's the right decision. 

We're both in our 20's, and are in seemingly similar places of being kind of alone and unsure of if it'll ever change. She tries to act like she's having fun, but she seems lonely deep down, and I am too. The way we carry ourselves is similar, of being the type who is more quiet and reserved, who acts like we've got it together, and takes awhile to open up to someone. 

I didn't feel an immediate spark when I first met her, although I did feel an attraction. I don't know if this yearning for her that I've been feeling is actually feelings for her, of it's just me being scared of being alone. I am the type to take awhile before accepting that I like someone.

The last time we spoke there was mention of a New Years party, and I expressed my interest in going. I went because I thought she was going to be there, and she wasn't. She knew I was going to be going, and if she were interested in getting to know me, she should have been there. She also looked right through me when holding a door open once, so I don't know if she likes me at all. 

She has a tattoo in the same place that my ex does. This worries me because it took me awhile to accept liking her as well, and she turned out to be a very cold, deceptive individual.  I also built my ex up to be this deep sensitive girl that she wasn't. I don't know if I'm doing the same here.

Good-looking men with markedly less attractive female partners,"I'm curious to find out what goes through your mind when you encounter a man who is, to all appearances, a good-looking or otherwise attractive guy, romantically partnered with a woman whom you regard as unattractive — she may not even be physically unattractive, generally speaking, but when her looks are contrasted with the man's, you can't help but notice a discrepancy.

To be clear, I'm not implying that there should be a match or a close gap between one partner's physical beauty and the other's. I should also note that to explore this idea it would be best to imagine that the ""discrepancy"" is significant, i.e. a guy you think is *hot* with a gal you think is physically unattractive.

We're all familiar with the usual explanations and judgements people give when the situation is flipped (hot gal with physically unattractive guy), but I'd like to see what you have to say should you come across a couple in the opposite, presumably less common scenario. Draw upon actual experience or just imagine what you might think.

I'm wondering about things like your knee-jerk reaction and what you might speculate about the nature of the guy's interest in his partner. I think it's fair to state that men disproportionately favour youth and beauty compared to other qualities, so I have to imagine that when a woman sees a man apparently holding other qualities in higher regard, that it must stand out; it must make you think.

I also wonder what you might think in this situation should you happen to feel strong sexual attraction towards the guy, or should you have a genuine desire to date or become an intimate with him — *and* you regard yourself as better-looking than his current partner. Alternatively, what if his partner were about as equally attractive as you? What if she was more attractive? I would imagine that you would experience different thoughts and feelings in each scenario.

There's more detail that I could add to my hypothetical scenarios, but I'll leave it at that. I'd be interested to see what anyone has to say on the topic, even if you don't directly address any of the specific situations I mentioned above.

I'd love thoughts on my response to cat-calling.,"I have ptsd relating to a domestic abusive situation I escaped.

What do you think about the guy when he is nervous and awkward while approaching you?,"Everywhere it’s said that women hate it when a guy approaches but is nervous/awkward. However, I have this curiosity to know if that’s true  for everyone.

A little background.  I am a less than average looking guy because of a snub nose. But take  care of my health and hygiene. I’m good with social interaction, keep  making friends and do really well with clients (I’m in consulting).  Saying this just to let you know that I’m not awkward in general.

One  thing which is a pain point for me is that if I have a crush on  someone, I CANNOT be the same confident guy when I’m approaching them  for just saying hi. Even if I know that they’ve seen me being really  confident with other girls.

Here’s  the reason I’m asking this. There’s a girl I had a huge crush on and I  kept catching her looking at me and we had tons of eye contact (it was  borderline crazy). But then I approached her to say hi when she was  alone and I was nervous. She definitely saw through it and went cold  after that. And I backed off.

I  have been in a situation when I was talking to a girl who was nervous  and I really liked it. May be because I can relate to that and know that  it’s genuine.

So my question is:  do ALL women get turned off for sure when the guy is nervous when he’s  approaching for the first time? Do they think ‘oh he’s nervous probably  because he likes me’.

So my question is:  do ALL women get turned off for sure when the guy is nervous when he’s  approaching for the first time? Do they think ‘oh he’s nervous probably  because he likes me’.

tl:dr: What do you think about the guy when the he is nervous and awkward while approaching you?"

Would you consider this needy/desperate behavior?,"I've been going out with this girl for 2 months now and I've been on the verge of asking her to be my girlfriend. Our dates go great; I feel very connected to her and there's a sense of comfort and warmth to being around her that I've never felt before. We've both admitted that we really like each other and want to see how it'll progress. The issue is that I feel there's a disparity in our ""needs"". 

She's busy, is out from 6 am - 7pm most weekdays and takes care of her grandma at home sometimes. But she also heads out with her friends quite often. We see each other 1 or 2 times a week, never more than a few hours. I'm absolutely fine with how often we see each other a week, might like to spend more than 3 hours with her sometimes but it's cool, I get it. I feel like I only feel needy the days between dates. 

We really only text about when our next date is or what we're gonna do, which is great and all earlier on but I don't see things progressing. Sometimes I'd just like to call her up, once or twice a week just to hear her voice, ask her how she's doing, tell her about my day, that sorta thing. If she can't call, that's fine! Maybe we can just text for a while some days, not too long, just have something more sustained than what we have now. 10 minutes. I don't care. I just wanna know how she is, what's going on, learn more about her and vice versa. I don't need to do this every day, I'd just like to get to know her more outside of our dates. 

I don't know. Most of the time she takes nearly a day to reply, which means I can't really communicate with her well this way. Usually on our dates she'll take out her phone and drop a reply or two to her friends though, and she's fairly active on her social media. 

I asked a couple of friends about this and while some say it's just differences between us, others say it's me being too needy or clingy or whatever. And she has told me in the past she tries her hardest to make time for me, and I do try and believe her, but sometimes I feel like it doesn't take more than 30 secs to reply to me.

Women who grew up poor and/or without much family around - how do you overcome your scarcity mindset?,"I’ve been thinking lately that I never feel secure with my finances or with my social security net. I always feel like I need more saved to feel secure even though I think I’m doing pretty well for myself. I grew up with just my mom and my older sister in the house (but sister moved out when I was 9) and my mom always struggled with money. She was very good at saving but she never made much money. I remember crying at night sometimes when I knew my mom was going to lose her job or when she wasn’t working and I heard her quietly crying to herself about money. I was scared what it meant and created a lot of uncertainty  and instilled a lot of fear in me and insecurity. I feel it come up from time to time in my adult life, even though I have a big circle of people who love me and care for me (aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, friends, boyfriend) and I’m not struggling financially by any means.

Can someone please give advice on using a menstrual cup?,"My partner is a bit conservative (she’s from an Asian country), she has never even used a tampon but has bought a menstrual cup to try. I’m trying to be supportive but I’m a bit worried because she asked me the other day where it goes.

Women of reddit: have you ever recontacted a guy that you were dating after ending things because you weren’t ready for a relationship?,"I(27M) was dating this girl (27F) for just under a month and talked for 2 months. On Monday we ended things because she said she wasn’t ready to date. She divorced in July from a 9 year marriage, 10 year relationship.

She told me when we first started talking that she was good. I mentioned to her that my friends believed we should make things official and she said that triggered her that she wasn’t ready.

I told her I understood completely, she needed to heal. I said it sucked cause we were getting along so well and things seemed to be going great, but I understood. She was honest with me saying she felt if we kept seeing each other it would be harder on me and that she didn’t want to hurt me.

I said if she decides she’s ready to message me and if I’m not with somebody, as I want to be in a relationship, that we could try again, as I really liked her a lot. I thought about maybe checking in on her from time to time to see how she’s been doing.

How do you act when your feelings are moving from a friendship to a relationship?,"The text is just my personal situation. I'm wondering as I've unexpectedly developed feelings for a friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I \[24M\] am a total late bloomer (starting University 4 years late). Last summer I had a major increase of confidence and eventually in October got my first girlfriend \[19F\]. I started hanging out with a friend \[19F\] who I lived with last year (University students) more concidentally at first, then deliberately as we progressed from 'flatmates' to 'friends'. 

I'm planning on ending my relationship after exam season (my friend knows this, as my other flatmate asked about my relationship). Though I started getting real feelings towards her, but it's hard to know if she's just being nice.

I've had lunch with her family, she makes me custom gifts (I've done the same) and I have quite a lot of in-jokes and references with her. I've genuinely never got on so well with a girl. I spent a whole day with her yesterday and she  text me saying she really enjoyed it. I honestly feel completely proud to hang out with her, to the point I wouldn't mind introducing my family to her even though I tend to push my family to one side at times. 

I know physical touch would be a super obvious example (my girlfriend I picked up on signs from like that) but I'm not sure if it's improved much. I've hugged her a few times after gifts and twice when she looked really upset (the day after she found out I was dating someone - she said it was exams) but it might just be a case of hanging out more as friends.

I wrote this whole post moreorless ignoring my current girlfriend, but I've mulled over the relationship for about a month now. If it becomes a habit of falling for girls too quick I'll take note, but I've never had such an enjoyable platonic friendship with a girl as I do with my friend.",AskWomen,"How do you act when your feelings are moving from a friendship to a relationship?The text is just my personal situation.

Screw the Mirena IUD,"I got the mirena December 2018. For over seven months I was continuously bleeding which put a damper on my sex life. Also my sex drive was WAY down. I didn’t have severe cramps during the seven months, but I was so tired of it. I got it removed and still the bleeding didn’t stop, so then I got on ANOTHER birth control the nuvaring yay. After having it in for three weeks, I took it out the fourth week to hopefully regulate my periods, but I ended up with excruciating cramping to the point where I had to go into the ER. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, always had painful periods but this pain was on another level. Has anyone else experience this or something similar? I feel like I’m going crazy! My doctor said to be on the nuvaring constantly now to not experience that pain again, but I’m so sick of hormones I regret ever doing this. The whole point i got on birth control was to help with my heavy periods lol.",AskWomen,"Screw the Mirena IUDI got the mirena December 2018.

How should i (M26) react when i notice my girl likes the attention she gets from other men?,"Sometimes i notice she kinda likes it when other men look at her. She makes the same face like when i tell her she looks nice. The other day i was waiting for her at starbucks and i saw her walk by a guy and smile really big at him when he looked at her.

I think its normal for women to like feeling pretty but it feels wrong watching her like it so much. I notice she puts more effort in her looks and it doesnt seem like its for me.

Advice on CyberCheating,"Hi, so I am having relationship issues. So my boyfriend and I have been together for 11 months now. He “cybercheated” with the girl who I was always worried about. He was blackout drunk and we had gotten into an argument and apparently I had said I was going to break up with him. I’m not sure what this argument was because this was back in May. I didn’t find out until September bc I couldn’t shake the feeling of this girl so I had messaged her. Keep in mind this girl liked my boyfriend from November to May. I was always worried about her bc she was my boyfriends #2 best friend on snapchat. She was his only friend at school. That’s why he talked to her so much. He flirted with her for two weeks while him and I were talking in December. We weren’t serious so that isn’t that big of a deal. We started dating in February. He had the opportunity to choose me or her and he chose to commit to me. He cheated on me that night in May bc he knew she was easy. She was sending him cleavage pics and he was obviously edging it on. She apparently did this multiple times while we were dating but he only flirted with her that night. Never sober. He tried masturbating to her that night but couldn’t. I don’t want to get any hate for going back to him. He has changed and he was deeply hurt for what he did. He was scared I would break up with him if he told me. But he did lie to me almost our whole relationship. He’s cut off all girls and doesn’t hangout with any outside of school and never did while we were dating. I’m not saying he’s changed just to say it, he has. I’m just having trouble healing bc it’s 4 months later and I don’t want to hold it against him anymore. How can I learn to trust and be less insecure? He never liked her or anything. He just didn’t want to have no friends at school which is why he didn’t cut her off. I have good days and bad days. The bad days are rare but today is one. I feel overwhelmed and feel like I can’t take it but the next day I’ll be fine. Please give me advice rather than trashing my current boyfriend. He’s a good guy just made a dumb mistake.

Please help me. I think my vagina hates me.,"October 2019 I got my very first yeast infection. I went to the doctor got 2 pills &amp; took one the first day, my symptoms went away so I didn’t take the other one( big mistake I KNOW). It is now January 2020 and I’ve had 3 YI off &amp; on for 4 months. I treated them with monistat, began taking daily probiotics, changed to a sensitive frangrance-free soap &amp; cotton underwear. Everything was great, my vagina &amp; I were bffs for about a month. But THEN, on January 8th I got my nexplanon removed &amp; put a new one in (it expired December 2019) &amp; about 2/3 days later the yeast infection came BACK. I also had an STD scare January 8th so I was extremely stressed out for about a week &amp; I feel like this might also be the cause of it but omg I am losing my mind. I am so uncomfortable in my own body. 

SO, these are my questions:
1. Can an expiring nexplanon cause hormone changes that can prompt a YI? Has anyone ever gotten a yeast infection after getting Nexplanon inserted?

2. Can stress cause a YI? I was doing great until that whole scare happened so I am very suspicious but I am also unsure if it was just perfect timing.

I (m) want to help my friend (f) who has a fear of commitment. Only I don't know how.,"Hi /r/AskWomen. I've got a female friend of mine who I love dearly and I need some advice on.

Little bit of context; we met while we were both studying abroad 7 years ago. I went through a nasty breakup at the time and was quite down and out. She helped me out, we've been good friends ever since. We also live about 1500 miles apart so our friendship is mostly text-based, although we see each other 3-4 times a year.

My friend has since stayed in the place we met (I'd rather not divulge any personal details for privacy) and has built a life for herself. She's set up a business with a few friends that has since expanded to multiple holdings both domestic and abroad, has a close circle of friends and a lovely house. There's one thing missing though, and that's a male partner by her side.

She's been in multiple relations over the past 7 years, none of which have really worked out. First guy ended up cheating on her, second dude forgot to mention he had a three-year old kid with another woman and ended up being a reality TV-star and the third guy was a wealthy homeowner who loved to do cocaine on the weekends. All in all, they weren't the best catches.

This has resulted in her completely shutting men out of her life. Don't get me wrong, if you're not ready for a relationship then by all means don't. However recently I've begun to pick up on signs she wants to get back out there. Things like ""I was at a party last night and I was the only single person in the room, that sucks!"". You know? However, her past relationships have led her to build a fear of commitment. It's gotten so bad that every time she's texting with a guy who VERY CLEARLY is interested in her, she asks me to forge the replies because she's afraid of talking to a guy in the first place. Over the past few months, she's cancelled multiple dates at the last minute and has one lined up that she's considering to cancel as well.

She fully admits to have commitment issues and I don't know where to go from here. Apart from active encouragement, Tinder coaching and the glaringly obvious advice (*go see a fucking therapist*), I really don't know what to do here. I want what's best for her and help her with this issue how I can, but I really don't know how to. Any advice?

Asked girl out and she said she would let me know if she could this weekend.,"Women of Reddit,

            Last week I met this girl at a work happy hour. I am new so I thought I would go and meet some people. While there I met her and we kinda chatted on and off through the happy hour and near the end she said “so are you single or are you dating someone” in a casual manner and I said “no.” She and others invited me to go to another local bar afterwards and we talked more there and found out we have a lot in common and I became really interested when she said she knew how to play settlers of catan the board game which not a lot of people know how to play (especially girls) I have found. 
To wrap the story up we ended up going to another place and talking more but with a few other people and I got her number at the end of the night. I texted her the next day and thanked her for showing me around the new city and she responded. Later that night I actually went back to the happy hour spot as a friend had invited me to go eat and drink and it just happened to be the same place. I sent her a picture of the menu and made a joke about a food item she had that just had way too much salt. She responded and we talked for about twenty minutes before the conversation ended naturally. 
This is where it has me questioning if she’s actually interested. I texted her that night (drunkenly) and it was a picture of the settlers board game I was playing with my buddies but she didn’t respond. I hit myself over the head for it because I got out of a long term relationship a few months ago where my partner cheated on me. So, with new girls I’ve met I’ve almost kind of ruined it because I am rusty and would be a little too eager or come off as desperate. I said I wasn’t gonna do that with her, but alcohol got the best of me. With that I waited 4 days to text her and yesterday I asked her by saying “If you’re not busy this weekend we should go out for drinks as I need to be cultured in the city’s bar life” She took about 4 hours to respond, but said “Hey! Yes you do! I might be going out of town this weekend though, but if I don’t I will for sure let you know.” I said okay sounds good and left it at that. My question is ladies how does this sound to you? I thought she was pretty interested but again my confidence has been kinda down lately. Should I text her again in about a week if she doesn’t respond or just learn to take a hint?

First offense DUI drugs - what can I expect from my court date?,"this is my first Reddit post so I’m sorry if this ain’t in the right community.

This happened last night in GA. I was driving from the store, saw three cop cars in the street so I thought they were looking for someone, stopped, put my blunt out and proceeded down the road. The officer stopped me because it was a road check and saw the blunt on my thigh and told me to hand it to him. I did and got out of the car, gave him my license and my mom gave him hers. He asked me how much did I smoke today and I told him once this morning and the one right then. They did a sobriety test and I guess I failed because they put me in handcuffs without reading me my Miranda rights. The only thing the officer read to me was the blood work consent paper and I (probably stupidly) consented. They took me to the hospital, did the blood work and then the officer dropped me off at booking. I made bond that night but had to be held for 12 hours in another county and was released today at 11:30 AM. My court date is November 12th and Monday I’m talking to my lawyer. This is my first offense, I have no criminal background or record and was charged with DUI drugs and a misdemeanor under an ounce. Was held mandatory 12 hours in jail, had to take mug shots and all and now I’m basically withering away with anxiety waiting for my court date. Here are my questions:

Does it mean anything at all that the officers didn’t read my Miranda rights? Will that help at all in court?


Will the blood test even be accurate if I’ve been smoking since I was 10 years old? Wouldn’t marijuana be in my system anyway because it’s been so long?

Is getting a lawyer worth it? 

What should I even plea? 

What should I expect? 

I’m 22, have (or HAD) no criminal record, nobody was hurt, I wasn’t in an accident, the car was completely fine and they even let my mom drive it back home. When they searched it they didn’t find anything. The officers were also being rude to my mother, accusing her of smoking too when she hasn’t touched marijuana ever. She doesn’t even know what it looks like. 

Before you preach at me this has been more than an eye opener for me. Jail is not for me, I cried and had panic attacks and was on my knees praying. Those were the longest 12 hours of my life and I won’t touch or even look at marijuana ever again. I hate I put my mom in that situation and I’m so disappointed in myself because someone could have gotten hurt and I was not thinking. I will never make that mistake again. Please any advice is appreciated.

Should I (20F) email my ex (26M) back after a month?,"My ex (26m) didn't do anything wrong that made me want to break up with him I just knew that we weren't right for each other in so many ways and I wanted to be single, not so I could mess around but so I didn't have a relationship to put energy and time into, which was a hard thing to explain. The outcome? I felt guilty right away, I just felt like such a piece of shit for doing it in the middle of the blue and in the worst way possible, over the phone while he was away working in Alaska. We didn't date for very long only a few months and we had nothing special, our conversations were always so vague and surface leveled. He never showed any interest in what I had to say, so I tried my best to not talk when I was with him because hey, what was the point? plus he ""gets annoyed easily"". Anywaysssss to my surprise he was a mess after this happened, a mess that I had once experienced myself in a different break up, which made me sad to know. But it had been months since I had seen him and it was hard to have shown any emotion or empathy when he got home and we met up.. especially because I am not the best with my emotions. It resulted in him getting angry with me. a few weeks later he came to pick up his stuff, this time even more frantic and angry and me showing no interest in this conversation. He even tried to drag my roommates and best friend into it. I don't blame him for acting a little bit crazy since I wasn't showing much emotion, but my explanation just wasn't enough for him so he wouldn't let it go but i gave him what i could and at that point he should learn how to walk away I mean he's 26 for goodness sake. I was going to email him to apologize but my friends and family told me not to because his anger scared them and they thought it would be best to just leave it. A few days later he ended up emailing ME. It was an apology, quite nice to be honest. I wish I would have responded but I was in the middle of moving to a new state so I didn't find the time. A month has gone by and I feel it is too late and I don't want to bring back old emotions for him, especially because he originally asked me not to. I just hate day to day thinking about how I hurt him and how I showed no interest in his time or emotions afterwards which could have only hurt worse. I don't want to be friends with him but I hate how I left things. I honestly don't think that an apology letter or any sort of letter will help him have less resentment towards me. I'm uncertain how sending a letter may or may not help me. But I still feel guilty. And I still feel bad.

Or have my insecurities just attracted the wrong type of people? Please help

We met 3 years ago, we now live together, and he wants to get married and have kids in a few years.

**Problem #1: His difficulty with owning up to his faults**

While I can tell he loves me, he really has some growing up to do. He has a hard time seeing &amp; owning up to his faults, and it's always a crazy battle just to get him to see his mistakes. While I'm glad that I can eventually get through to him, it's really exhausting because he uses all kinds of ego defense tactics in the process. He'll scapegoat me (somehow make it my problem, so he doesn't have to take responsibility), stonewall me (he'll just go silent and stop talking/space out, try to get out of the convo and not follow up, etc.), project his problems (he'll accuse me of doing what *he's* doing when that's not the case), etc.

Every time this happens, he apologizes in the end and says he'll work on his problems. However it's been 1+ years and he hasn't really made much progress. It's a major turn off to me because I don't want to have kids with someone who is emotionally immature and unable to see things objectively. He just told me that he's going to get a therapist and start reading more books on self-development though.

**Problem #2: Our difference in religious/political beliefs**

Another potential issue is our difference in politics/religion. I am agnostic, support same sex marriage, and pro-choice while he is Christian and against both of those things. He didn't even tell me he voted for Trump until months into our relationship, even though I asked him on our first date (he didn't really answer my question and changed the subject). He also didn't really reveal to me just how Christian he was until later too.

I have been respectful of his religion but have been unsure if it'll bring up issues. Especially since he just revealed to me that he'd want me and our kids to go to church on Sundays. I'd be okay with him taking them to church, as long as we each present them our views and let them decide on their own (which he's willing to do) but I definitely do not want to go there every Sunday. He seems to be okay with this but I'm worried it'll bring up problems later.

What strategies do you use to protect your time?,"I've always been a bit of a people-pleaser and am also an introvert. I'm working on becoming comfortable with saying no, disappointing people, etc, but it is a deeply ingrained tendency and slow going.

It feels like I spend a crazy amount of my free time doing things because I'm hoping to satisfy other people's wants and expectations: my husband, whose expectations are high (of everyone, including himself); my long time best friend, who I'd qualify as a bit needy and also with high expectations; my parents, who recently split up and are both feeling lonely and who I now have to see separately when one of us can make the 8-hour RT trip; of course my work; and the lower but still relevant expectations &amp; time needs of my relationships with everyone else I care about, not to mention my own anxiety-ridden, high-standard self. 

I feel fortunate that I have many people in my life who love and want to spend time with me, but I feel like my mental health is reaching a breaking point. I feel deeply guilty when I go too long without seeing certain people, especially my parents as they're going through a hard time, and negotiating plans/pushing back when I'm asked about plans can be so emotionally tiring for me that I just end up saying yes.

Personality change for the better,"I've been married now for 20 years. I have it a huge roadblock. My wife has progressed and changed as a person. She is has now become very ethical and principled. But she has said I'm more or less the same guy since we've been married.

We have had several fights over this to the point we are going our separate ways.

She wants me to build on my personality and change to be a better person. The question is how do I do this?

She is not into the material stuff and could care less for the wining, dining and presents. I am more of the traditional type of guy who would love nothing more than do this for her; but she doesn't want this. I have always let her do what she wants, buy whatever she wants and adore and love her to this day. I have never raised my voice at her, given her lots of attention and I always do whatever she wants me to do. 

Even when we do have arguments, I always sit and listen to what she has to say (even if it goes on well over an hour each time). I always apologize for my wrongdoing and say that I will change but she never believes me.

I have told her I've changed by not hiding/lying to her anymore (I realized I did this a few times to avoid arguments but it backfired on me big time) but she doesn't believe me and still does not see any change in me.

"Zero sex drive after recent Pap smear, and the thought of sex grosses me out","Hi. I’ve been feeling weird lately and need to express it somewhere, and maybe get some advice.

I am 23F, I’ve been sexually active since 15, and have never had feelings like I have now. I’ve been with my partner for ~3 years and up until recently our sex life was great. Over the past few months, though, I have had zero desire to have sex, and the thought of having sex/orgasming makes me feel gross. Like I don’t want it, at all. 

In my own mind, I’ve blamed it on having three abnormal Pap smears over the past two years. They’ve all come back LSIL but during my last Pap they used a microscope thing and I could see what they were seeing on a screen. They showed me my abnormal cells, I could clearly see them and could clearly see how they differ from “normal” cervical cells. That shit freaked me out. I feel diseased and gross, even though I know I’m not. 

Anyways, when I think of sex all I can think about is like how the penetration is affecting these cells and it fucks with me so bad. Sorry, TMI.

Has anyone been through this? Or even just been through multiple abnormal pap results? Looking for any and all advice. Thanks.",AskWomen,"Zero sex drive after recent Pap smear, and the thought of sex grosses me outHi. I’ve been feeling weird lately and need to express it somewhere, and maybe get some advice.

How to get justice against a predator?,"The other day, I was sitting outside of a coffee shop in the shop-provided chairs when I noticed to my right, no more than 10 feet away, an older man was sitting and staring at me from within his car. His window was cracked.

As I continued filling out my papers, I occasionally looked over. At first, I would glance and see he was still looking at me; then, I would stare back for 5 seconds at a time and he would not look away, he would just stare deeper and more menacingly.

Eventually, I’m on the phone with my dad about thirty minutes into noticing this man staring at me. When I told him about it (which I’m sure the man heard due to our distance and the volume I was speaking at) my dad told me to take a picture of his car. As I lift my arm, my papers fly away so I stare at the man, pick the papers up, then set them down under my bag. All this time, he never lost eye contact with me. 

His tongue was hanging out of his open mouth and his eye contact was increasingly sexual and menacing. I walk towards the car, still on the phone with my dad, notice the man is masturbating to me, then after I loudly yell he’s masturbating, I take a picture. 

The picture is a clear shot of his face, car, and license plate.

I ran inside with my papers because he hadn’t stopped staring at me and masturbating even while I took the picture and said that. I was so scared of getting any closer or being in danger for any longer.

I went to the police but because I didn’t see a penis, they said no crime took place.

Today, after some searching, I learned he is a registered sex offender and I now have his address.

Since the cops won’t get me justice, I want to get justice myself. 

I know a group of tall, strong men who are enraged and who will be with me and protect me if I need it. But, I just want to read things you recommend I should do for justice; and, if you have any tips to be safe, I’m open to reading those, too.

Toys - how does this affect your playtime with your man,"Hi Ladies

My Fiance recently forgot her pill, and we're extra careful about the whole pregnant thing. I'm looking for some advice regarding ladies in relationships that have toys with which your man pleases you. I'm a little scared that if I get a vibrator that the experience will be better than what I can offer (i.e. it's more stimulating, or bigger than me - I'll probably try to get one that's more or less my size). Does this actually influence your sexual encounters with your man? Keep in mind she is a g-spot girl, does not like clitoral stimulation.

My parents are very overprotective and they're trying to get me to take someone else with me even though I prefer to go to this concert alone. So my question is, is going to concerts alone as a woman inherently dangerous? Have any of you ever attended a concert by yourselves? "

"Jerk thing for BF to post, or I'm being too ""sensitive""?","So my boyfriend last night posted this ""joke"" to Facebook. He's a funny guy most of the time, and I GET a good joke. I also easily laugh at myself, and don't mind being the butt of a joke. But this, to me, is different.

Question regarding being “too wet” during sex.,"Hey ladies,
Ok so extremely embarrassed to be posting this but here goes nothing. 
I just got into, what I’m hoping, a long lasting relationship with my boyfriend. 
We have sex regularly, if not more than regularly since we are only a couple months in, and the other night after quite a bit of foreplay and me getting very aroused, we had sex. A little while in I noticed he didn’t seem to close to finishing so I stopped and finished him off another way.
Later that night I brought it up and he said it was because I was so wet. Now, I have never been told this before, and no I do not “squirt” but yes I can admit I was more wet than usual. He is average size btw. 
Does this happen to anyone else (please say yes) and if so, how do you take it/ is there anything I can really do?

How do I(24M) regain my girlfriend's(23F) trust again?,"I recently did something really stupid that I am coming too heavily regret. I've been with my girlfriend for about almost 2 years now  and love her immensely. Sometimes though, as a very fickle and vain person, I seek the validation of strangers because of my ego. Because of this, I kept my online dating account that I had and sometimes upload pictures and swipe accounts to see if I get matched with another like. After a couple matches I deactivate my account and never do anything further.

A girl that I saw several years ago reached out to me via text yesterday night and asked me how I was doing. This was completely out of the blue and never happened to me before. I told her I would rather talk to her on the online app where I met her and asked her to swap to that. My thought process was that this way, my girlfriend wouldn't see it by accident and I would be able to mute or ignore the conversation if I wanted. The reason I still have my account (I keep it deactivated) is because I use it at times from my friends to use as a template and for them to read the conversations I had. Thinking about this was an incredibly stupid decision and I should have just told my girlfriend the moment she reached out to me.

 I found out that the girl I had previously dated now lives in Asia and will not be coming back anytime soon. That was what sparked my curiosity to reply back to her. The last time I saw or talked to her was when she was in college in the States. I ended up not replying further and forgot about it when I went to see my girlfriend today.

When I came back home, my girlfriend called me and asked me if I was hiding anything from her. She told me that a friend of hers found me on the dating app and asked if it was me. I knew I fucked up, and came clean to her about everything that happened, and that I did nothing but talk to her and was not going to do anything other than that. She rightfully told me that I had broken her trust and became very upset.  She started asking me if I thought that she was crazy for acting the way she did and I told her it was completely understandable. She said she needed some time to think about things and that's where we are now. 

I've since deleted my account and immensely regret what I did. Is there a way to save this relationship and regain my girlfriend's trust?

What would your reaction be to meeting an attractive guy who wanted to wait til marriage for sex?,"I am a 21 year old guy, never had sex or even kissed a girl before. Ive been told I’m attractive by others, (I’m definitely not posting a picture of myself but I’ve been told a few times I look like Jake Gyllenhaal) so that hasn’t been a problem for me. I think growing up with 5 sisters and being the only boy (second to last age wise) had something to do with me getting to this point in my life.

I had girls flirt with me in HS and elsewhere but for some reason I never pursued. I’m not sure why.

But I know that I want to have a family one day, one of my greatest desires is to have a son, so that I can be the great father and husband that my dad never was. 

Now I expect most girls wouldn’t think negatively about me being a virgin, but with me wanting to wait I’m not sure how that changes. 

I’m very focused in life, right now I rarely text anyone (two close friends I had moved far away) I have no social media presence at all on any platform, I mostly just read, study, partake in my hobbies like working out, and of course work and soon to be starting school. I do want to learn piano soon too.

To give you an idea of me as a person I’m in amazing aesthetic shape, I speak two languages (English, native, and Russian), I’m a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I’m just kind’ve a stoic guy. I’m reserved and might even be characterized as “boring” by some. INFJ type for those who know what to do with that info. I’m hoping one day to join the FBI or CIA.

(Bragging is not my intent here at all, as you will never know my true identity, I’m merely laying out my character to aid with answers)

I don’t want to have a “holier than thou” type persona but it’s hard for me to find a girl in... *equivalence*? to me... if that makes sense. A lot of women nowadays are involved in hookup culture and that sort of scene and I’m definitely not into that. 

As far as *why* I want to wait for marriage, well I just have come to believe it to be something greater than ‘fucking.’ There is all kinds of science regarding the chemical bonding between a couple during sex, and there’s heavy studies correlating abstinence til marriage have much lower divorce rates. 

If I’m not mistaken, the divorce rate in america is something like 50%! If studies show by simply waiting to have sex can drastically lower this (whatever the reason is, really it doesn’t matter) than I’m taking that path; I absolutely do not want to go through a divorce, especially if I have kids.

Sorry for the ranting, so I guess back to my original question: I’m just worried about finding a “unicorn” as some men would say. MGTOW, which I think extremely misguided, would tell me I will never ever find a girl like the one I desire, but I just don’t believe that. 

So as a guy who’s starting to enter into dating, what would your reaction be, knowing all that I’ve told, to my desire to wait til marriage for sex? I’m nervous I’ll get laughed out of the building or she’ll just laugh and leave, and I don’t necessarily want to experience that over and over and over until I find a girl who has the same desire... 

Maybe I’m overthinking girls judgment nowadays, I’m sorry if I came off wrong in any way when speaking about girls, I’ve literally never been romantic with one, only lived with women as sisters and of course my mom.

Any reply is welcomed and thank you for reading my post.

Maybe I’m overthinking girls judgment nowadays, I’m sorry if I came off wrong in any way when speaking about girls, I’ve literally never been romantic with one, only lived with women as sisters and of course my mom.

Any reply is welcomed and thank you for reading my post.

How would you feel if your boyfriend/husband confessed that they were struggling with porn addiction?,"I'm a recovering porn addict in my twenties. I've gone on several attempts to quit porn since I was 16. I ended a 3 months streak of staying clean when I relapsed last weekend. 

During the times I was off porn, I felt like I had control of my sexuality. I wasn't so easy controlled by my emotions and others' impression of how I looked. I just acted and behaved the best I could everyday. I wanted to be there, to make the lives of others better. When I was on porn, it was all about me, me and me. What I wanted out of a friendship with my female friend, what I wanted to portray myself as.

During the 3 months of being porn-free, I had significant leaps in my friendships with women. These are strictly non-romantic relationships. But now that I've relapsed, I fell back into a place of misery. Porn does affect the way I interact with women and I feel like honesty can help me recover.

If your best male fried, boyfriend, or even husband confessed that he was recovering from porn use, what would be your response?

Instead of just ending it there by asking her if that's what she wanted and if it wasn't, to just leave her alone (Because it would've probably been awkward to continue from that), I went for getting her Facebook, because I thought ""well the chat is already pretty flirty, she looks average and she doesn't seem like a bad girl let's just continue hitting up on her"".

I need insight and guidance from other women regarding the situation/dilemma I find myself currently in.,"I am a 20 yr old Pre-Nursing student. I have my entire career mapped out for myself. I want to finish Nursing school, do residency at a hospital for 2-3 yrs to get experience in the OR, PICU, PACU, L&amp;D, ER, &amp; etc. Afterwards, I am looking into transitioning into traveling nursing for a while—this will give me the chance to see the world, gain even more experience from each of the hospitals I have assignments at, &amp; allow me to network. That way, when I finally decide where I want to settle down at [whether it be in the US or outside of it] I’ll know people &amp; won’t go into an area blind or uninformed.

The career outlook is very rewarding &amp; I only see the “$$$” as an added accessory for being in a field that allows you to save lives, bring life into the world, &amp; take care of those who’s lives are coming to fruition. I would very well be capable enough to take care of myself and someone else, without seeing so much as a small dent in my pockets. 


Here is where the situation arises:

My boyfriend of 3 years is 19 yrs old. He is faithful, never done any wrong by me, knows how to take care of himself, etc—he is essentially the perfect boyfriend. The only problem is he doesn’t know what he wants to do with his life.

He suffers from Crohn’s disease. Unfortunately, he only recently found this out, due to me asking him about his health history &amp; bringing up to the doctors the more detailed information. He doesn’t want to get on any medication to treat it due to almost dying from an allergic reaction to Reglan. He is also very cautious &amp; iffy about doing anything that will cause him stress or induce flare ups, due to almost dying via choking in vomit within recent years.

He has expressed to me when I talk about Nursing, that the stuff he wanted to do or was interested in got put onto the backburner because of his illness &amp; doesn’t go any further than that when talking about it. It makes him depressed to talk about it—he even refuses to go to therapy because he hates reliving the events. Whenever it comes to terms of how much money I’ll be making after graduating from Nursing school, he says that he feels like a bum or he feels bad because he doesn’t know what he wants to do or can do, so the only thing that sticks out to him now is music.

Yesterday, just to get a feel of his headspace regarding his dependency of me, I offered to help him with his music. He goes “are you sure about that?” I said I wasn’t &amp; expressed how I did not want to be in a position further down the road where our career choices become a deciding factor in the relationship or who’s the breadwinner to become the deciding factor in the relationship. I suggested that he take up something part-time to help fuel his creative passions &amp; voiced that I didn’t mind helping him, but he had to exhibit the willingness to do it on his own first, for himself [because of how he is with depending on other people &amp; how it makes him feel] &amp; only then would I consider pitching in to help. 

I asked him what other stuff he was interested in &amp; he said he didn’t want to discuss it anymore at the moment. 

I don’t think what I said was wrong at all, and I understand that we are both still young &amp; finding our ways in the world, but I do not want my money to be the only money he is looking at and feels that he can just be ideal &amp; comfortable &amp; not participate in anything—or think that sex or occasionally cooking dinner or cleaning is going to make up for his lack of career ambitions or using his illness, to an extent, as a crutch as to why he is afraid to do this and that.

I don’t think what I said was wrong at all, and I understand that we are both still young &amp; finding our ways in the world, but I do not want my money to be the only money he is looking at and feels that he can just be ideal &amp; comfortable &amp; not participate in anything—or think that sex or occasionally cooking dinner or cleaning is going to make up for his lack of career ambitions or using his illness, to an extent, as a crutch as to why he is afraid to do this and that.

copper iud -- in your experience/to the best of your knowledge: does ANYTHING influence bleeding in between periods?,"I've had it for 9 months. 

Some months it's like there's nothing there and I love it.

But maybe half the time, I've bled in between periods -- near constantly. 

It's embarrassing with my partner and just downright inconvenient. I don't want to have to wear a pad for half/nearly the whole month. 

I haven't yet figured out what factors might be influencing this, if any. I do get ovarian cysts every month, but it was my understanding that those would cause me to bleed prior to my period, not immediately after (which was the case this month).

This month, I had my regular period (3-4 days), but have bled almost every day for a week since (a couple of days ago the pain and the discomfort was so bad, I was convinced my body was rejecting the IUD). I went to the doctor the day before yesterday to have the IUD checked and it's still in place (but they can't scan me for a month!)

I feel like just regulating mood/hormones generally could make a difference, but I've no idea. Exercise, special supplements...I don't care what it is, if you thought it made a difference, please share.

Abnormal changes in your breasts as an 18 year old?,"I wasn't sure where else to go with this because Google gave me zero answers, but I was hoping I'd have some luck here. This is my first time posting here so I apologize if the formatting or even the question isn't appropriate. 

Anyways, I've grown increasingly concerned with the changes I've experienced in my breasts.  I recently turned 18 in January, but I've noticed these changes over the past 6 months or so. My breasts have seemingly got smaller. I still fit a C cup, but it's almost like they've deflated a good amount? They're also A LOT softer, it's like there's nothing in there. There was a period of time where they grew quite big, almost like they swelled up. Though I think that may be normal as your body changes at my age. But I think my situation may be different considering the changes I'm experiencing seem to only happen to women going through menopause or when they're pregnant. I know for sure that I am not pregnant. 

One thing I really do not like is how when I'm laying on my back, the skin on my breasts is super loose, like I can pull at the skin an lift it up. My nipples almost concave. Best way I can describe it is, they're squishy! Also I've noticed they may be sagging a little more than usual as well. I would like to add that I have stopped wearing bras that support, and instead wear bralettes. But that was before I noticed these changes. I read that going braless is better so I'm not sure..

I'm just really confused how they went from full and perky to feeling deflated. I'm upset because I was very confident about them and now I feel insecure. I would really like to get some answers as to why this may be happening, whether this is normal and they'll go back to their regular size. Or that maybe it indicates an actual problem with my body.

I am (f17) experiencing the absolute worst pain of my life,"/sorry in advance for the long narrative of my pubescent life, I just want to make sure someone can make the best educated guess they can off the info I gave them/ 

I started getting my periods a month after I turned 11. Since then, they have never been late. They follow a strict schedule. However, they’ve also been incredibly painful. Until maybe freshman year i would be bedridden the first day or two from throwing up, cramps, lower back and joint pain- the whole nine yards. 

Late in my freshman year I went to an OBGYN and brought up a thought that maybe I had endometriosis, she entirely dismissed it and told me I was too young, so I go on birth control, the first one I was one worked wonders, but it was super expensive so I switched and it made me gain weight and upper depressed so I stopped all together. 

Fast forward to now, my senior year. My periods are still god awful and without a calendar I can tell when I’m ovulating because the cramps and the headaches aren’t bad, but they’re there. I went on the “generic” brand/type (that’s what my NEW OBGYN called it) of the birth control I really liked freshman year. 

I’ve been on it a month and a half now, so still too soon to tell if there’s any change. But this is where I have my issue 

Yesterday while I was getting ready for prom, I didn’t know it at the beginning of the day but yesterday was my ovulation day, and it felt like I was suddenly stabbed in my right ovary. It was nauseating pain. It made my head spin and I broke out in sweats. I felt like I was shot. The pain lingered for an hour or so. I took Motrin with food and a bunch of water. I waited and waited. No relief. I got extra strength midol and a soda.. nothing. 4-5 hours later I take 1 more midol with dinner, still nothing. 

The pain comes in waves and it lasts for around an hour or two then it’s gone for maybe 30-45 minutes. When I got home last night I took a hot bath as that usually helps, nothing. I got a heating pad and laid in the fetal position, as that’s my go to when I start my period, still absolutely nothing. In fact this position made my mouth salivate like I was about to vomit. This last incident was around 1 am. 

The pain woke me up again at 4:30 am. 

I have taken Motrin. I had a lidocaine patch. I took pamprin. I went out and bought lower back heating things and wore it over my right side. Nothing. I had to sit in the walk-in at work because I was so dizzy and in so much pain. 

At this point I’m incapable of taking any more pain relievers, heat does nothing, sitting does nothing, laying makes it worse.. it’s awful. 

I’ve never experienced anything like this and I’m just curious what in the ever living hell it could possibly be.

"I (22f) made out was a guy last night, 1 week after getting dumped by my ex. I don’t know how to feel","My ex of 2 years dumped me after 2 years. He said we were incompatible but honestly I’ve realized he’s an extremely unstable insecure guy, dealing with too much personal stuff, and projected his insecurities on me.

Tonight an old guy friend asked me to get some beers. He’s moving permanently across the country in 8 months, so obviously I didn’t think it would go anywhere real. But we had a really fun time, and I went to his place and we made out a bit and messed around. It didn’t feel as bad I thought it would be to be with someone else. He felt different and kissed differently but it was ok. His lips felt thinner but he grabbed me harder. Just... really different. He wanted to go further but I didn’t feel comfortable with it, so he walked me home. We live 3 blocks away. My ex of 2 years didn’t even ever offer to walk me home once, and we live nearly 3/4 mile from each other. It was crazy and I was really taken aback, but he insisted on making sure I got home safely.

I feel weird. I was attracted to this guy, no emotional strings, and I had a good night with him. But I also feel odd that I just made out with a guy 1 week after being with my ex.

How to befriend other women?," 

I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with me. Just to start I would like to say that I do not hate other women. I am \[ 23, F \]

It seems like since I was a child i've always been friends with boys. My mother was gay, so I certainly didn't have a lack of females in the house. but she had a lot of 'masculine attributes' and often joked about being a rather masculine lesbian (which her partners often were as well.) Everyone in my family always referred to me as the tomboy. I just seemed to gravitate more to the boys in my extended family rather than the females. I liked to get muddy, play with frogs, catch snakes. as a kid I didn't really notice much, although I was bullied by other girls a lot for it. so that made it difficult in general to make non-male friends, as no girls would really accept me as being one of them. I was practically raised by my cousin (who was more like an older brother) he got me into video games, comic books, sci-fi.. I thought it was cool at the time, but as I got more into it I got bullied for it by other girls.

In middle school and high school I grew some close female friends- but still seemed to get along better with guys? it wasn't that I wanted too, my girl friends would just often remark that I was too blunt, or my jokes were too offensive. I knew how to fight- so it was simply easier for me to have a place in the guys group. one minutes you're scrapping, the next you're best friends again. Girls never seemed to be like that? I found myself apologizing a lot to keep them as my friends.

After high school it grew more difficult for me to make friends with other ladies. It just always feels like I don't have enough in common with other girls, though I would like to! I wear makeup, I do my hair, I dress very feminine. but I work in a car shop and the other girls who work there often remark that they are better than other women because they're working on cars, and their boyfriends will never find a cooler girl?

I don't know. I don't like this- I'm not sure why. I just want to know how to be more of a girls, girl. When I had a pivotal moment of asking my long term boyfriend why he was so attracted to me - he said 'you aren't like other girls'. which I guess is supposed to be a compliment? but it sort of just made me feel like an outsider, because no matter how hard I try I can't seem to be accepted by other women.

I just want to know how to make more friends that are women. What do women typically like to do? Where can I meet girls that (as terrible as this sounds) aren't offended by everything? I'm not racist or sexist. I wouldn't say my jokes go overboard or anything, it just seems like most women don't like them.

I see women around me with best friends and lasting female friendships. I want that. I only have one really good female friend and she is transgendered (MTF) and when I ask her about it she says that because she was raised as a male (obviously) we have an alike personality.

Can someone please just give me some tips on where to meet people? Do I have to change myself? I feel like an outsider. I know this question probably looks dumb.

How do you feel about dating someone with no emotional baggage?,"I (20) am dating this guy (22) and he’s great. He’s fun, polite, smart. Here’s the thing. 

I grew up with parents divorced when I was a year old. Narcissistic emotionally abusive father who I cut ties with at 16. Toxic family who betrayed me and tried to hurt my mother and grandmother. Worked to protect them and never felt i was protected in the meantime. 

Developed depression which has brought me to the to the dark place and unfortunately made me comfortable with it. Dealt with that for the past 6 years. It’s made me who I am and that’s good and bad. It’s taught me to listen and be kind to people and understand them when they’re depressed so I’m often a source of comfort or empathy when people are going through bad times and I’m so happy to do it. Dark humors pretty fun too. 

But I also have issues in relationships. I’m afraid of men, afraid of being trapped or silenced, afraid of not having my space (even though I’m an extrovert and love people lol try to figure that one out). I’m afraid of love, because i know it can be real but so much more often it is wolf in sheep’s clothing. And worse? I learned sometimes people can truly think they love you when they’re hurting you or abusing you all the while. Going to therapy for all of this now and working on getting better:)

Back to the guy. Parents are happily married. Perfect house, great siblings, parents pay for college, parents very well off, no history of mental health issues (from the way he talks I don’t think he even fully understands or appreciates what depression or anxiety can be like. He’s just never had to think about that). Asked if anything terrible had ever happened to him and he couldn’t think of anything at all. I asked what was the moment he felt he changed from childhood to adult. Mine was when I was around 6-8 comforting my mom after breakups and keeping the peace between my parents as an only child of divorce. Or 16 breaking away from the toxic parts of my family and trying to rebuild what’s left. For him? It’s right now, when his parents are asking for advice about retirement investments (he’s in finance). 

I think it may cause a problem in the future. When I try to talk about things I’m dealing with (note that otherwise generally I’m very positive and upbeat and energetic), he doesn’t really ask questions, or even seem to understand like these concepts are so foreign. 

The best way I can describe it was with this comics short I found https://youtu.be/bq4sO_AtbAg 

Bottom line ladies I have to ask: 
How do you feel about dating someone with no emotional baggage? 
Are broken (and repaired) people meant to be with others of their kind leaving the unshattered to remain as they are?

I’m afraid of men, afraid of being trapped or silenced, afraid of not having my space (even though I’m an extrovert and love people lol try to figure that one out). I’m afraid of love, because i know it can be real but so much more often it is wolf in sheep’s clothing. And worse? I learned sometimes people can truly think they love you when they’re hurting you or abusing you all the while. Going to therapy for all of this now and working on getting better:)

Back to the guy. Parents are happily married. Perfect house, great siblings, parents pay for college, parents very well off, no history of mental health issues (from the way he talks I don’t think he even fully understands or appreciates what depression or anxiety can be like. He’s just never had to think about that). Asked if anything terrible had ever happened to him and he couldn’t think of anything at all. I asked what was the moment he felt he changed from childhood to adult. Mine was when I was around 6-8 comforting my mom after breakups and keeping the peace between my parents as an only child of divorce. Or 16 breaking away from the toxic parts of my family and trying to rebuild what’s left. For him? It’s right now, when his parents are asking for advice about retirement investments (he’s in finance). 

I think it may cause a problem in the future. When I try to talk about things I’m dealing with (note that otherwise generally I’m very positive and upbeat and energetic), he doesn’t really ask questions, or even seem to understand like these concepts are so foreign. 

The best way I can describe it was with this comics short I found https://youtu.be/bq4sO_AtbAg 

Bottom line ladies I have to ask: 
How do you feel about dating someone with no emotional baggage? 
Are broken (and repaired) people meant to be with others of their kind leaving the unshattered to remain as they are? 
How do you talk to your SO about things you’re feeling without seeming like you’re playing victim or looking for pity? Do your unbroken partners listen?"

Am I an idiot for still being friends with my rapist?,"So I think the title says it all but let me expand on that a little. We were good friends all through high school and we had kind of a thing for a few years and we discussed being intimate on multiple occasions. Eventually, we did get together for a while, but most of the time when I’d go see him, I’d tell him I didn’t wanna do anything and we’d do it anyway. I just kind of went along with it because I was afraid to say no. After a few months, I got a boyfriend and wanted to stop all sexual contact with the friend. He agreed but the next time we hung out he forced it. After that, I cut off all contact with him for months before he reached out and asked what he had done wrong. He seemed genuinely surprised that I had considered it rape and he’s been trying to make it up to me ever since. He has been very understanding of how uncomfortable he makes me and we’ve been working towards being friends again, without the sex. Am I an idiot for fixing our relationship?

"What Female Content Creators/Singers/Artists, do you think guys should check out and might enjoy?","I'm a guy, and I had a friend of mine who was looking through my phone at my music and she made a note that I had very few female artists in my music playlist, and she also asked me what female content creators I followed on YouTube and other social media, and I think at the time I had a limited number of artists that were women (only about twenty percent of my playlist of nearly two thousand songs, which roughly four hundred isn't terrible, just percentage wise it's less than stellar), and I had zero content I consumed from female content creators on Youtube, Twitch, and other Social Media sites. It's definitely not an intentional thing, and in my main genres I listen to for music Alternative and Rap, the population of women is smaller than male artists. Same with what content I consume on social sites, I watch a lot of stuff about video games, sports, film production, shows I'm interested in, etc.   


Anyways, since my friend has mentioned to me my lack of female created content I've actively searched for more female entertainers in areas I have interest in. And over the last couple of months I've really fallen in love with singers like Halsey and P!nk who are incredible vocalists, and since I love singing, it's just amazing listening to them. Janelle Monae is fantastic, older artists like Tracy Chapman are incredible not only as performers and singers but as people with the lives they've lived. As far as content creators go I've found a group of streamers on Twitch I enjoy watching, because they're great entertainers. Annemunition and Lil\_Lexi are both streamers of a game I really enjoy, and I actually watch them play games outside of my interest, because I just really enjoy them.   


I'm not trying to balance out my content evenly male to female, but I've definitely realized how male-dominated my media consumption was, so I've been looking for female-created content really just to explore more than anything.

"Would you date a guy who, at 21, already had 60 sex partners? (50 prostitutes + 10 regular girls)","Hi!

This guy is me.

I'm quite insecure over this past/ present of mine because, as ironic as it may seem, I am extremely romantic and somewhat idealistic. I would love to find a girl that I really love and who loves me back and to become committed to her. I wish to marry someday, as well. (Sooner than later).

However, I never hide anything from my love interests, and have no intention in starting to do such. And well, a lot of them react quite negatively when they hear about my body count. I'm really anxious to know whether there are many people who would not only tolerate, but accept this part of my past, or if most are gonna throw stones at me, like my ex did when we broke up (I was loyal to her, BTW).

In case you're asking ""Why did you have sex with so many prostitutes?"" the answer is that it all started as I, 17 at the time, earned quite a inheritance and decided to pay to experience what I would rarely experiment otherwise. So I started with a trans girl, then I went to have a threesome, etc.. But soon it became a habit. Later I started to go out with prostitutes hoping to find a girlfriend among them, because it looked like they were pretty much the only people that would accept me the way I am, doing what I had done.

About non-prostitutes, most were one time hookups from Tinder, a few were friends with benefits, and one was my only serious relationship, which lasted for 9 months.

"So, what do you exactly mean by 'emotional labour'?","Maybe it's because my first language isn't English, maybe it's because I have autism, maybe it's because I've never had a romantic relationship or just plainly because I'm a man, but I have the feeling I've never really understood what you women mean when you say we put too much emotional labour on you and with that I mean what does emotional labour mean specifically. I've read around a bit and listen to a couple of episodes of The Gender Knot (can recommend :)), and I have a broader understanding of it, but it seems like many women mean different things by it, like sending post cards for birthday/Christmas cards to vacuuming the living room.

Casual Convo Fridays,"Over the next few weeks, we are doing a test run of Casual Convo Fridays. This thread will post every Friday during this period.

So every Friday during the trial, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, and invalidation (this test won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

Help! Am I being ghosted??," 

Sorry if this a little long. Hi, I am a 22 (m) that's been talking and seeing this girl (22 f) for about two weeks now. We matched on Tinder last Sunday and had been chatting up a storm, texting every day and snapchatting each other in that time up until Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

I got her phone number last Sunday and she joked that I better not be a serial killer because she gave me her real number. The banter was great, lots of jokes and conversation; we met up for coffee. She lives an hour away in another state and mentioned jokingly worrying that she gave me her actual address. Before then though I mentioned that it was definitely in her right to say no since dating is dangerous for girls and I understand. She said she knows that and wants to give me a chance because I'm charming and the best conversation shes had in a while and worth giving a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

The date goes really well. I pick her up, we get coffee and chat and grab drinks. We talk about shows, movies, books, her singing in a band, me writing and etc. Regular date stuff. Night comes and we make out on a bench in her town and head back to my car. We make out in the back of my car and I do some hand and mouth stuff (to) her and we both joke about not having sex since I don't have a condom and how we both really don't want to have kids. I drop her off at home kiss and make plans for seeing each other in my town a couple of days later since shell be gone for half a week some days after.

&amp;#x200B;

She came up to visit me in my hometown. I'm still at home with my parents so I got an Airbnb which she didn't mind. We had a great time, at least I think so. We went grocery shopping. I made us pizza and made a bunch for our host and the neighbors. We noted jokingly they could hear us so I wanted to compensate somehow. Lots of physical bedroom stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

One of us mentions the joke about her coming to visit me in the Airbnb and she states that she gave out my number to all her friends and the address that we were staying at. I agree that it was definitely a smart idea because well, safety first, duh haha.

&amp;#x200B;

Sex was a little awkward because she mentioned that she wasn't that experienced and had only been with 3 guys before me. I could tell as she was a little sensitive to me joking about it and also let me take the lead. She definitely seemed to have a good time since after the botched sex the rest of the time there I focused on taking care of her, 9-10 times. She mentioned when her friend was over how a friend was in a car accident but that it wasn't serious We also went out to get coffee drinks later in the night and she fell asleep to her movie suggestion and me wanting her to get some shut eye since she tells me she doesn't usually sleep that well. That leads to the morning, more fun things with her and we go our separate ways after a kiss. I told her I had a lot of fun for her to drive back safe. She lets me know that she got back in one piece. We both sent each other snaps to one another about driving safe etc. she left me on opened, that's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at work and asked her what she was up to since she got back a few hours after she told me that and sent her the Airbnb review the owner left us and jokingly jabbed that I did all the work. Crickets.

&amp;#x200B;

That leads to yesterday morning around noon when I asked if everything was cool and sent a quick snap joking if she was already tired of me. She opened it 12 hours later at midnight and posted a selfie with her friend going out an hour later. I was a little upset earlier because I didn't understand what I did wrong then figured it might have to the accident thing or a family emergency. I got a little creepy and checked her snap score the past two days to see if she was on Snapchat and she was scarcely using it and only posted a story going out last night. Probably just talking to close friends so I understand. The opening my snap and then posting a story thing kind of hurt though.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't know how to feel and my ego is bruised and my feelings are pretty hurt. She mentioned how she liked me a lot and I did too. It's not like I was planning anything serious or wanted a lot but we have some things in common and have great conversation and good (improving if we still see each other) sex.

&amp;#x200B;

I might be overstating the tone and frequency of the serial killer safety thing. We also had a conversation at length about that over text and in person and also about toxic masculinity and the like. She even came up to see me when she really didn't have to.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do now because I definitely want to give her space and not say anything?  I wouldn't know what to say since I'm a little upset that she would do this. I'm thinking about sending a text on Sunday saying:

I look at guys at the gym and think they have the bodies but do they have the brains as well? In a lot of cases I doubt they do but they still get the girls so obviously aesthetics must hold some initial attraction.

Granted, USUALLY they’re occasional comments/observations that don’t necessarily lead to any deep conversation, but just some form of acknowledgement from who I consider my two best friends (we’re a trio of girls) would be nice.

Tips for breaking/stretching a thick hymen,"Hi y'all! 

I am a 19 YO F, and I fingered myself once during masturbation and it hurt incredibly as if I was being stabbed down there. Later on when my bf fingered me with his pinky it was the same feeling, and his dick didn't fit in either. 

We both realized that my vaginal opening is extremely small, so I assumed I must have a microperforate hymen. I went to the gynecologist who said that my hymen is thicker than usual. A while later, when I checked myself down there again with a hand mirror, I saw that my hymen got stretched a little bit. 

From you ladies who had a thick hymen too, did you get surgery or did you break/stretch it on your own? And if so, were you able to have painless sex afterwards?

Ok to ask a man I’m dating to go away on vacation with me?,"Hi everyone,

I recently started dating a man and really like him. We get along well and have been seeing each other for about a month and a half. With July 4th coming up, I’m really tempted to ask him to go away on a trip with me but am wondering two things:

1) Is it too soon to go away with him?
2) Is it weird of me (the woman) to be asking him? 

I’m terrified of coming off as clingy and don’t want him to run away from me as a result, even though he’s shown considerable interest in spending time with me.

Thoughts??",AskWomen,"Ok to ask a man I’m dating to go away on vacation with me?Hi everyone,

"Ladies, I’ve (29M) started dating a girl (26F) who admitted after sex she doesn’t think she’s ever had an orgasm. I want to treat the issue with respect but I’m baffled and I want to have a healthy sex life with her.","TLDR; New relationship is starting, she clearly has a sex drive but says she’s never come. She says people have tried to get her there, but now she seems resigned to the issue. I don’t know what I’m dealing with or the best way to approach it to have a healthy, two-way sex life.

Here’s the Story:

I’m smitten. She’s smart, quick-witted with a dry sense of humor to match my own, compassionate, stunningly beautiful and has a dog :) By all accounts, she feels the same and we’ve been seeing each other 2-3 times a week since this started a month ago. She seems to have a healthy sex drive as she’s been the one making advances on me but for the first 2 weeks that mainly led to a lot of playfulness and touching. I’ve been letting her control the pace as she *just* got out of a long relationship. Then she tried to have sex but got her period.

So after a little delay, this past Friday I come over after a bizarrely stressful day at work and she initiated sex after dinner. I break for water like 20-30 minutes in and she goes “Why haven’t you come yet?”. The answer is I’m still stressed from my day and first time sex is pretty exciting. But even if I hadn’t had those interferences, as a guy it’s less to worry about if I get the girl to come once first so I would’ve been trying to hold out anyway. So I deflect and ask if she came. To which she responded “Oh I don’t come”.

Im my mind I’m going **what???** but sex is delicate so I tried to handle this new information as such and just asked “You mean you’ve never had an orgasm?”. “No. Or I have been and I haven’t been realizing?” she responded. I said “Well ladies have different types of orgasms, but you’ve never had a full blown shuddering, heavy breathing orgasm?” And she said “no”.

Later we’re cuddling in bed and I said “I want to give you an orgasm” and she says “People have tried. I don’t know” I ask if she has any toys and she says no. We fall asleep and she wakes me up at 2am being playful, I hadn’t come and clearly she wanted me to, I come pretty quickly and we go back to sleep. We’ve had sex twice since then.

But now what? I’m no master of sex, but I’ve been in  a handful of very open and exploratory sexual relationships. My last relationship had its faults, but we had learned how to have very frank discussions with each other about sex, what turned us on, and things we wanted to try. We used lots of toys, watched porn together, and figured out just the right order of things to get her to squirt. I haven’t spoken to her about this at length as this is a new relationship and I don’t want to push anything but to what degree it’s relevant I think she’s only had 2 serious relationships and possibly only 2 long term sexual partners. It does not seem like she’s explored her sexuality as much as I have, but I don’t really know that and even if so, I don’t know how much this has stood in the way of that. On two separate occasions I tried to go down on her and she pulled me away, she didn’t seem comfortable with it.

I’m not going into this new relationships with any specific expectations but I do want an honest, reciprocal, and healthy sex life and now I don’t even know where to begin. I’m in no rush and I want to treat the issue with compassion and respect but again, I don’t even know where to begin. I feel like I don’t know how to have sex without thinking about making the girl come be a part of it. Going down on my partner or making them come is a huge turn on for me. The foreplay associated with that is a natural pet of sex to me. Not to mention the fact that there’s a certain amount of pride involved in satisfying your partner.

I want to make her come, I want to help her explore this part of her life. I don’t even know how much of this is physical, mental, chemical, whatever. She clearly has a sex drive though as she’s been making a lot of advances on me but i feel like I don’t even know what she’s getting out of it. I mean I know foreplay and the act of sex itself is fun, but is that all she’s excited for? If it’s relevant at all even when shes initiating and clearly horny she’s not incredibly wet and we’ve had a little trouble getting it in, she also says she usually gets a UTI a few days later every time she has sex.

Need some advice regarding potential signals from a girl,"I know that reddit isn't the best place to ask about these kinda things but I don't have anyone else I could ask without judgement so here we go. Also idk if I should post it in another sub but this one seems active enough to get some actual advice, if it breaks any rules or should've been posted somewhere else I'll delete it. 

So 3 weeks ago, at regional table tennis competition, I met a girl who turned out to be going to the same college as I do (we're both freshmen so 19 year olds btw). Not like we clicked or anything, I'm really quiet and shy so I was pretty much only talking with my two finds who I know quite well, but I warmed up with her and that's basically all the contact we had. She ended up winning in her category and I got 3rd place in mine so we both advanced to the next (national) stage. That was basically all that happened back then, except for me having a breakdown when I got back home cause she was just so cute and I felt so lonely for some reason but that's another story.

Anyway, back to yesterday she messages me on fb and asked if I'm planning on going to the next stage of that competition and she wrote 'ahh, too bad'. Then she asked me if I knew the name of the other guy from our college who was supposed to go there and I sent her a link to his profile, wished her good luck and I also added that she has a real chance to win that whole thing and I'll be rooting for her. She thanked me for that and for my help.

I just left the shower and I keep thinking why she messaged me when she might have as well found his profile by herself (there was a post on our college's fb page with all our names so if she could find my name she could as well found his that way, and if she remembered my name, why mine and not his?). So the question is: am I overthinking a lot and she was just asking if I'm going there out of some politeness or there might be more to it?

How often are you dissapointed by men who debase themselves with selfish lust - Read my recent experience and comment please,"I put an advert up on craigslist for some ""Zoloft"" for help with mental health issues and it's used for anxiety, depression, panick attacks and  post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder etc

It's not a controlled medicine and so although you technically need a prescription it's not in anyway wrong to possess this even though I do have a prescription.

I recieved responses from a couple of men and it turned out they wanted sex in exchange for a few packets of mental health medicine that I'm too poor to buy.... what kind of a human would do that? 

I'm asking is this type of thing common and is anybody else as repulsed as me?

I told my friend no i have no interest and no i'm not sending a picture to you to send to your friend, to send to her.  

so my friend and I went out and they ended up showing up regardless.  the girl ended up at one point coming up to speak to me, and we exchanged a few pleasantries, the conversation was ok, we shared an interest in music in common, she has a good job i have a good job.

"I was born with deformities, and I feel quite lonely as a result of this.","Hello Reditors, for a little while now I have had this want for a romantical partner. But I have some difficulties finding one who is attracted to me. One of my main suspects to this is because I was born with a mutation on my ALX 3 gene which results in cranio and facial deformities (I have a mild version of the defect).  

And it does not exactly help that the people around me seem to be showing of their wonderful and loving relationship left and right. I know I am surrounded by people who love and support me, but small comments like “Try lowering your standards to your own level” or “Maybe you should just accept the fact that no one wants you that way”. Makes me feel quite insecure and sad. 

Is it just me being too sensitive and “desperate”. Or is what I’m feeling okay? Would appreciate getting some advice dealing with the comments too.

Need some advice!,"I (27M) met this girl (25F) at work about a week ago (we work in a corporate environment). The moment we met we really hit it off since we had a lot in common. I got her number and after a few days I asked her out and we went on a dinner date. It was great! We talked for like 6 hours straight about everything and we both really opened up to one another. I really saw something special in her. We’ve been texting back and forth with her mostly doing the initiating. 

Now, today I decided I would ask her out again this weekend and I had some plans in play (decided on some stuff we would both like). We were talking at lunch and when I brought up “btw what are you doing Friday - I wanted to take you to so and so...”. She said she couldn’t do it because she had some family stuff which she explained clearly and it made sense because she had mentioned it before. I made a little small talk about the family thing. She didn’t mention an alternative date so then I asked “what about the next day?”. Which she replied by giving some clear thought to it and said at night she would be free but then I realized it wouldn’t really work for me (don’t even know why I asked about the next day - was kinda just thinking in the moment). Anyways we didn’t talk about any other date after that and just made some small talk as I walked her back. Told her I would see her next week (since I’m off for a couple days) and we hugged and I left on what felt like a positive note. 

I think she’s amazing and I seem to like so much about her - we make each other laugh, we like so many things in common and I get this warm feeling around her. I’m at a point in my life where I’m very serious about my future and am very determined on achieving my goals and she seemed to be the Bonnie I could take on the world with. I’ve decided that I’ll still keep up with her through text and all but the ball is in her court if she wants to go on another date. Should I leave it there or should I be persistent and ask again in the next week or two. I’m really not for games anymore and am very motivated on where I want to get in life. 

btw I would say we are both really attractive and I’d think we’d make a great couple!

I’ve decided that I’ll still keep up with her through text and all but the ball is in her court if she wants to go on another date. Should I leave it there or should I be persistent and ask again in the next week or two. I’m really not for games anymore and am very motivated on where I want to get in life. 

btw I would say we are both really attractive and I’d think we’d make a great couple!

Thoughts anyone?"
How to rekindle friendship after sudden ghost?,"Hey all,

I had this one friend since elementary school and we've stayed pretty close until recently. We were still talking pretty frequently up until earlier this year, after asking for a small favor (being a reference for an art project), things just suddenly stopped and she never responded. We haven't talked since then, and the sadness has been eating me alive.

She was one of my best friends and I want some closure (or to reconnect if at all possible). We're both part of the same friendgroup, but I've always been more or less of an outcast.

I'm going to try reaching out to her, but how should I start the conversation? Will a simple ""how have you been"" suffice, or should I express some of my emotions?",AskWomen,"How to rekindle friendship after sudden ghost?Hey all,

Boyfriend of 9 years cheated on our anniversary night. I’ve never dated anyone else since junior high school. HELP,"I already posted this in r/dating but got nothing so I'm hoping for some friendly advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me just start by saying I don’t think I’m crazy by assuming he’s done this before and with other girls. I’m also not completely at fault, he and I have dated for over 10 years but he’s never met my parents. (I’ve never been with anyone else either emotionally or sexually) so this sent me down a dark hole.

We have joint accounts together, we share icloud passwords, emails and most logins. He tracks me on his iphone (this way we get to see each other's location 24/7 ) and I have his. This is for trust reasons. The part where I blame myself is that after nearly 10 years he’s never met my family despite us living only 10 minutes apart. My family is very religious and they want me to marry of the same faith. We’ve lived together in different parts of the city and get along great minus the occasional fights. We write each other lots of love letters. He has also stalked me outside my work and studio a few times and I’ve done the same to him when he’s successfully brainwashed me into making me think he could grab any girl and replace me.  We have broken up and gotten back together multiple times and have never spent more than a month apart which felt like hell.  I’ve lent him my credit and put big toy purchases under my name and he’s great in other ways. I have dragged this man through school and across countries to be with me during my university days and we’re both highly educated people with serious psychological problems. I’m sick of randomly driving around his spots to make sure he’s not cheating on me but I’ve invested over a decade of my life into this relationship. He says he loves me and I want to spend the rest of my years with him, I think he resents me for having kept him waiting for over a decade to meet my parents. I’m just afraid to upset them and I’m also afraid to lose him as well.

TLDR – we met when we were 15, have broken up and gotten back together multiples times, it’s a headache defending him against my parents who don’t know how serious the relationship is. It feels like heaven and hell at times. I don’t want to lose him but I don’t think it’ll get better until we move out and give marriage a real shot.",AskWomen,"Boyfriend of 9 years cheated on our anniversary night.

Have you ever uprooted your life for a significant other?,How did it go?,AskWomen,Have you ever uprooted your life for a significant other?How did it go?
my GF of half a decade just told me shes never climaxed via penetration. What do I do now?," 

I'm still not sure how to feel. I know I'm still hurt as fuck. We had a coming clean or honest conversation, I told her a deep secret/fear of mine and was expecting a night full of conversation based around that. What I actually received back was a tearful love of my life telling me she has never actually cum via penetration. Only clitoral stimulation and even that's very difficult for her. That shes been lying and acting this entire relationship about it.

Like I said, I still don't know exactly how to feel. I reacted well at the time. Surprisingly. I know she feels like an absolute monster for lying about it. And its not like she chose for this to happen to her. I understand that. It slowly hit me though. That stab of betrayal. 5 years of making me feel like a king after sex is a lie. I'm not sure how to be intimate with her again. It feels like I'm just taking advantage of her. It feels like everything I ""learned"" about her body is not true. All this running through my head as I start to cry to her. We get through that night. I somehow zombify my way through work the next few days. (Bonus stress: I'm being trained at a new position so I have to try to learn as much as possible as fast as possible. It's a good thing but god damn, timing sucks.)

Our first goal was to just make it through the day without breaking down in public. I think the worst part for her was I woke up for work the next day, just the first few minutes of being awake in bed, and I started hysterically crying. Ugly ugly crying. She knows it because when I ugly cry I make real weird sad loud noises. It came out of nowhere. It overcame me. She had to console me while probably feeling some of the worst feelings shes ever felt. We got through that day though. Then it was lets just make it to the weekend. We got there. We cried. We fought over stupid other shit. If I let my anger take over I start spewing venomous words at her. It's been a few days now. We are trying to be very understanding to one another. But this wound is deep and new. One day at a time. Be strong. Deep Breaths. Its new and that's ok. Are the mantras I've been telling myself.

We've had sex a few times since. It was notably shorter because I guess it was known now that I wasn't going to make her cum and I could just focus on enjoying the sex and not stamina for her sake. And she could focus on me cumming and not acting. But it just feels so different. We tried the vibrator, but I think the stress and pressure she put on herself to cum then got to her and we did not have liftoff. I think her past history of abuse and shitty boyfriends (abusive druggy porn addicts are the three defining awful characteristics from what I gathered about him/them) are a factor here as well. I want to be the port in her storm. I want to be the light at the end of her tunnel.

But we want to work through it. For each other. I love her, I feel so awful that shes held onto this lie for her entire life that it just became her reality. I feel so guilty that I haven't been the best boyfriend either. (Not a cheater so don't think that) I feel guilty that I haven't made her cum. This was honestly one of my worst teenage and collegiate fears. That I'm inferior some how physically or mentally or both. That I could never satisfy a woman and they know that so that's why I'm single and alone type thing. (I know its a complex, I need to work on it and am trying to) I'm trying to be strong for us. To be the one she can tell herself about, ""I told him my worst problem and deepest secret. And he stayed and he did everything in his power to fix it.""

So I come to you all, ego destroyed, foundations rocked, looking for guidance.

What can we do to reconnect and feel more comfortable around each other again?

What can I do to support her? She's worried not cumming via penetration is a life sentence. I remain hopeful.

What can I read to help my mental state? I've been so sad and so angry and everything in between. I've tried meditation and it helps my anxiety. But heat of the moment anger and arguments can get the best of me.

"Female professionals, how do you manage??","ok- I’ve been in somewhat crisis mode for a year. And I just turned 31. 

Please forgive me, my adhd is pretty bad RN just due to stress, and I think I’m a bit on the spectrum probably... and this is kind of how I write, long winded and everywhere. Hopefully some people will be able to read this and understand :)

I’m transitioning from basically working a blue collar job for a number of years to a more professional role. 

Most of my support network/ acquaintances come from a similar background as me. it’s been such a whirlwind this year; I’ve felt like I’ve had hardly no helpful advice.... I guess because I just know so few people on a real level that are in the “higher tax brackets” and in professional careers...idk. My main support network and family has been so supportive...but at the same time I’ve learned quickly I have to screen a lot of their advice...esp about money. I’m going to be making about twice as much as before, I mean, not crazy...but all of a sudden people are just giving me the worst advice about money...it’s been so weird. It was easier before when everyone knew I was broke. 

It’s just such a weird place. All of a sudden too, with my new peers...I’m trying to read them. I’m too loud, not pretty enough, too feminine, not feminine enough. I honestly don’t know what the heck to do so I’ve been avoiding and ignoring most ppl except for like a basic level I guess... 

Anyway besides all that, man...i don’t know. Seems like all this stuff from the past I thought I had worked through is coming back up; I’ve been trying to handle it by meditating, yoga, avoiding ppl...during my transition my healthcare coverage got weird and I just haven’t had access that I needed...it would’ve helped a lot. Plus my body is just doing wacky things now and no dr is helping me that I’ve been to see so far 🙄 I know a lot of it’s stress related and will improve once I start my job/ get settled in my new city.

25 yr male dating advice,"Last year my friend (let’s call her friendGirl) set me up on a date with one of hers. I met her at a coffee shop 15 minutes late and just talked her ear off so much about myself that she ended up leaving early. But saying too much wasn’t the only bad part; I wore basketball shorts and a t-shirt. I had no sense of style then and I was at a very low point in my life due to working on my mental health. 

About 4-6 months later she saw me again while I was waiting tables at a restraint, where I was bringing plates of food to her and her family and told my friendGirl that she was surprised because I acted very nice and professional around her and toward her family. 

Last night I sat on the couch with my friendGirl and we some how got to the topic of this girl and with enthusiasm she said that it was a wreck on the first date which I agreed to friendGirl. I asked friendGirl to apologize for me about it how I came without caring what I looked like and how I was so arrogant to talk about only myself and none about her. 

I finally know myself, I rarely come off as arrogant now and I pay attention to what I wear. I’ve been on a date recently that went well but my follow up was terrible so I messed up there, but she thoroughly enjoyed the date and wanted to meet again. 

FriendGirl works with her at a library. My first thought was to send her flowers and card asking her out on a date, my second thought is to buy chocolate and put it in the card and have my friend give it to her.

What do you consider a normal length of time between texts with a friend?,"tl;dr Denizens of /r/AskWomen, when conversations have reached a logical end, when would be an appropriate time to re-initiate conversation with a friend? What are some of your experiences?

To be blunt, I currently struggle with maintaining friendships, especially with women (as I haven't always had healthy views regarding interpersonal relationships with the opposite sex). I have had successes in the past, but nowadays my friends are those that I met in person and lived with in my undergraduate years, are men, and many have moved to other states. I have lost my previous in-state group of friends to a breakup.

One hard thing to navigate is appropriate lengths of time between texts. I tend to be very responsive when I am not busy, and really enjoy initiating and moving conversations forward and talking about anything. However, when conversations naturally end with some of these people I have contacted, it's hard for me to discern when would be a good time to initiate a new one (of maybe a different topic).

As women on this subreddit, in your experiences with your own friends, what are some of the conscious patterns you think about when texting with friends? Thank you for reading!"
Does she like me? How do I know?,"I'm 31m
6'4
108kg/230lbs or something
Muscular (my Abs are ALMOST visible!)

I believe that physically I'm quite attractive but I'm also a social train wreck, I know that one for sure.

I hate eye contact and human interaction generally, jokes go right over my head and being in a crowd scares me. I don't understand people and any cues as to what they're feeling also go over my head.

Anyway, a European woman I often see smiles at me but it seems like more than a simple smile we all do when greeting someone, it's a bigger smile like she's happy to see me, her voice changes a little when she first speaks to me, from a normal 'hello' to a more playful 'helllooo!' she sometimes blushes if we exchange a few sentences or if there's some brief eye contact.

I think because I'm so anti-social I give off some strong negative vibes, people sense that and instantly feel uncomfortable around me as I do around them, so I'm not used to having someone possibly showing some interest. Maybe because it's new to me I'm looking into it too much and actually it's nothing.

She's really nice and quite attractive but I'm not interested in her, I'm just asking here because I don't know what the signs are, it would be nice to feel like I've been noticed by someone. Loners still crave affection.

Any subtle things I might say or do to confirm my suspicions?

"What are your thoughts on ""the genders are equal"" +/vs ""the man should be a gentleman towards his woman""?","Hi all,

I'm thinking a lot about this atm. In certain (heterosexual) relationships, I can clearly observe both these two statements trying to live together in parallel:

1. both man and women are equal (rights, duties, opportunities etc)
2. the man should treat the woman as a princess (holding up doors, paying for both, giving presents, doing extra stuff at home just to make her happy etc)

Sometimes it does end up well, and sometimes it clashes. There are many examples I could bring up, let's go with this classic one:

&gt;Both have similar jobs with similar pay, but he is still expected to pay when eating out.

I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Personally, I happen to be all for gender equality. I dislike the thought that there are some chores in the home that are designated to the man and some to the woman. However, I feel like the ""radical 50-50"" approach could also awaken negative feelings from your partner. If she wants to be treated like a princess, then it is your job to treat her that way, right? But also - if so, are you truly equal...?

I don't want this to become a rant, but I think you get my thoughts, more or less. Would love to hear others opinions!

Dating A Co-Worker. (PLEASE READ),"Hello, so recently I started working part time at a bar. I recently met someone who works at this bar who is very attractive to me. We get along quite well, she's very sweet. I see her about once a week twice maximum if I have to fill in for someone which is rare. Now I know it's pretty much a given to not date a co worker cause awkwardness and stuff. But I feel being 18, this being a part time job, as well barely seeing her for 2/3 of my days as well as it not being my sole dependence on living makes me feel my situation is different to most.

Is she interested?,"Hello Reddit, I need some advice on this one girl in my class that I really like. There is this one beautiful girl in my class and one day, I decided to start talking to her friend telling her that I really like her friend (the girl I like). She was giggling non-stop and I asked her friend whether she was single, and her friend said yes. I escalated it by grabbing her attention and telling the girl I like ""you're hot"" and the girl I like gave a look as if I was a weirdo and I kept regular eye contact with her until she looked away. I know some girls do this to see which guys have confidence and which ones do not. After that, she started to open up and be very nice, and started answering all my questions. 

One day, we both finished class and it was only me and her walking, and we started talking and she eventually brought up a very boring topic, and after she realized it was a boring topic, she literally just looked at me and I said bye to her and walked away. My friends and I always go to the same places that the girl I like and her friends go to, and I once tried to ask one of her friends where she was to talk to her, and her friend took me where she was, but the girl I like left early. I'm sure her friends told her that I was looking for her, but I'm unsure. 

Every time I see her in class now, we briefly make eye contact and hold it for a couple of seconds. She flicked her hair twice (both sides like a shampoo commercial) while making eye contact (and without attitude) both times, and I was wondering whether this is an indication that she likes me and whether she wants me to come talk to her? I've looked into this hair-flick thing online and it says that this is a ""stand-alone"" sign she is attracted and it occurs after attraction has passed a certain level. She's a very good girl, so she's not as obvious as the other girls I've talked to when they display their attraction towards me.

I know some girls do this to see which guys have confidence and which ones do not. After that, she started to open up and be very nice, and started answering all my questions. 

One day, we both finished class and it was only me and her walking, and we started talking and she eventually brought up a very boring topic, and after she realized it was a boring topic, she literally just looked at me and I said bye to her and walked away. My friends and I always go to the same places that the girl I like and her friends go to, and I once tried to ask one of her friends where she was to talk to her, and her friend took me where she was, but the girl I like left early. I'm sure her friends told her that I was looking for her, but I'm unsure. 

Every time I see her in class now, we briefly make eye contact and hold it for a couple of seconds. She flicked her hair twice (both sides like a shampoo commercial) while making eye contact (and without attitude) both times, and I was wondering whether this is an indication that she likes me and whether she wants me to come talk to her? I've looked into this hair-flick thing online and it says that this is a ""stand-alone"" sign she is attracted and it occurs after attraction has passed a certain level. She's a very good girl, so she's not as obvious as the other girls I've talked to when they display their attraction towards me.

How do you deal with someone who you believe is taking on marginalized identities for attention?,"tldr: How do you deal with someone who you believe is taking on marginalized identities for attention?

Feel free to tell me to f off or get a life, because there's a small part of me who really thinks I should get over it and move on. 

But another, louder part of me has been pissed for years. 

I have a coworker, Samantha, and her husband. We used to be casual acquaintances and but it would get a bit rocky at times. We've stopped chatting each other for a year or so, and gradually stepped away from each other. I've moved away from all social media contact and she doesn't say hi to me when we pass in the hall at work. This seems to suit us. 

I've noticed that while Samantha and her husband considered me more fringe in my politics, and while they were progressive, now they are wildly more progressive than they once were as of two years ago. But I also notice that as we were pulling away from each other, I felt like Samantha was using my language, my politics, my opinions and slowly morphing them into her own - but in a weird twisted way. 

The first and only time we went out to dinner with Samantha and her husband, he loudly proclaimed they/them pronouns were ""not grammatically correct"" and ""stupid"" - I pointedly asked why he uses ""ROTFL"" and ""LOL"" in face to face conversations, if he \*really\* wants to nail grammar. Also, uh, using those pronouns is not hurting him. No answer except grumbles and how its not right. 

Fast forward a few years when ""they/them"" pronouns and non gender conforming identities are getting a lot more attention/defense, he outs himself as gender nonconforming and using they/them pronouns. (But don't tell anyone connected to his rich Republican father because they're trying to get money to remodel the basement!)

This kind of stuff has happened over and over again. Polyamory gets more attention/defense, all the sudden they're polyamorous with their best friend of several years. (No sexual activity, Samantha just vents to him a lot about her husband and they game together, and so they consider themselves polyamorous.) 

This happened with bi awareness - with Samantha openly saying she's bi, but angry that women never gave her the time of day so she could never date them.

Years ago, when health care was getting a lot of press, Samantha trumpeted that her husband couldn't even afford health care. (When I heard this at work, I bit my tongue. I knew her father in law was paying their rent, buying their cars and paid off their student loans. The trust fund ended up buying their house a few years ago.)

Obviously Samantha \*does\* want to help marginalized voices and is using a lot of politically correct vocabulary. The last straw was when I saw her husband on a facebook group ranting about how equality for one group can look like oppression for another, specifically concerning income inequality and sexism. 

I'm angry, I'm frustrated, and I'm worried about this couple inserting themselves in my new social hobbies in town because there's crossover in our interests, and honestly just don't know what to do. 

Part of my bitterness does come from my background. I've had to pay my own way in life, with very little financial stability, and too many years of 60-80 hour weeks/multiple jobs and ignored health issues. Maybe I'm just a bitter asshole?

Sex Troubles,"Hello i'm and 18 year old boy in college having sexual troubles with erections due to anxiety.

Last year I was about to lose my virginity and got so nervous I lost my erection. After that everytime I am with a girl all I can think about is losing my erection if I already have one or how I do not have one if thats the case. This psyche wards me from getting erect.
Since then I've had sex twice, but was extremely drunk both times. The alcohol lowered the anxiety which is why I know its a mental thing, but currently I'm at the point where I'm afraid to even try with girls because its extremely embarassing and upsetting to go soft.

I am looking for advice, I am not with a partner currently and I feel its weird to tell a new partner this right away. College girls aren't always understanding and are prone to gossip. Should I just go for it and tell them I'm nervous? 

Looking for any advice to help me enjoy having sex

Question for all the ladies,"Hello ladies

This is kinda dumb but I'm really curious what you guys think.

Last week I went to the barber to get a haircut.  Well apparently he was drunk or something ( he wasn't just kidding) but he put on the wrong guard on the clippers. He didnt realize he put size 2 guard on until he buzzed off the front of my head. I couldnt do anything else but to get a buzz cut with a fade. Thank God I have a head for it that a buzz cut actually looks good. I used to have hair like Robert Lewandowski but now I look like Lincoln  from Prison Break. Im 21, 6'4 with a muscular build. So now I get either one of five impressions: Just got out of prison, military, S.W.A.T, bouncer, Russian or Polish Mafia (depending if I wear a suit or not😂) (also I'm Polish so I look very Eastern European ). The vibe I got from all the girl is that I look very ""hard"" or intimidating. 

I kind of like this look right now as it's so low maintenance and I got used to it, but I dont know if its killing my chances with the ladies (I've made some new friends at a party a week back and they said that if they didnt know my friend (who I met them through) there is no way they would of approach me first). 

I guess my question would be how do you ladies find intimidating men? As in not like creeps but attractive men who look  intimidating? Like a hot solider or something? I used to get approached by girls a lot more when I used to look less ""lethal"" but I dont know if they are just afraid to or don't want to.

Anyway this is a dumb question  but I'm putting it out there if anybody wants to give their input!

How do I stop valuing the attention of men over everything else?,"There’s so much to this for me personally, but I feel like if I include too many details it will take away from the point I’m trying to find out. I know I’m not the only one out there who struggles with this, so any advice or feedback welcome. Please be nice, I know this is a flaw and I’m trying to work on it. 

I value the attention of men over anything else. I am 28. A professional. Healthy, stable, feminist, liberal, body positive. I would rather have the attention of men over anything else. If I can have the opportunity to hang out, I won’t want to do anything else, including see my friends or family. I am attached to my phone and always waiting for the next message. I can be chatting with 5+ men a day and it wont be enough. The other day someone I was dating mentioned how he is sure to work in time for himself; i.e biking, reading, etc. it’s like I can’t even understand that. I try to force myself to see friends, do solo activities, put my phone down, set boundaries, etc. I do an okay job, but it’s only because I know it’s what I should do, not what I want to do. This definitely interferes with my life, although my life is generally pretty good. I consider myself to have pretty good self esteem. I’m obsessed with sex, but I believe it’s only born out of this need for attention, and “love”. I don’t actually want to fall in love, but I want my partner to be obsessed with me. I break up with possessive and obsessed guys because I know I should, but honestly I love it. I know I need to focus on myself, I just don’t know how, or how to summon the will power to leave it alone. I think if I truly tried just being alone I would fail. I don’t have the self control. Sometimes it truly feels like an addiction, but I know it’s definitely a habit. I didn’t have any male figure in my life, and I was sexually assaulted long, long ago. I know these things affect me in some way but I’ve always felt on okay terms with them. I just know that’s not the only reason.

Is it a big deal being made butt of jokes by others in front of your girlfriend? If so why or why not?,"I have a very bossy/domineering/critical sister who I find hard to describe. She can be really horrible and can be very cold sometimes. She will sometimes take the piss out of me which I don’t usually mind but sometimes it’s too much. 

Worse thing is my brother in law will often join in. I’ve often flipped out on both of them and told them to fuck off and walked off. It really gets on my nerves. I was out with my sister today and she mentioned for the second time “your girlfriend likes to take the mick sometimes doesn’t she” which isn’t really true and if she does it’s very light in comparison to what my sister does so I was like “no but would that amuse you” she didn’t say anything. I just don’t want to be made a fool out of infront of my girlfriend. I don’t mind slight ribbing but my sister takes it a step too far. And I don’t welcome it from her husband. 

I know I shouldn’t let it get to me but I just don’t like the principle of the situation. Any advice on what I can do to get her to shutup once in a while. Or just to stop getting wound up. I know she’s my sister and this is what they do but sometimes it’s relentless and I find it belittling.

Is dating as a flatchested woman really harder?,"I found a random article that compared being a flatchested woman to being a short man and said that we are often ignored / overlooked for this specific reason...

Half of the men on a dating site would pass if a girl had hardly any boobs and a good part of the girls would pass a short guy / a guy shorter than them.

It's not really shallow because you cannot control what you are attracted to.

Actually big breasts in women (or decently sized) and height in men is a sign of evolutionary fitness. More men like big boobs because of the fertility factor and more women like tall guys because it hints a man is capable to protecting a woman / has physical strength etc

I did a research and all I find is that for most guys it is not a deal breaker, some men like smaller breasts (it might be the truth but I find it hard to believe at this point), boobs don't matter etc

Honestly it sounds like BS to me or having small breasts / a flat chest would not be seen as a flaw. At best it is more like tolerated if you have a nice ass, a fit body or other positive features.

It is kinda like having no ass / a flat butt. It is a negative trait regardless...

Please don't bring up celebrities who are flatchested but have gorgeous faces (Natalie Portman is the first one that comes to mind but there are a lot), a pretty face is a good compensatory factor. 
Same for supermodels, gorgeous bodies and faces plus they are literally forced to be stick thin to fit the ideal etc

It is pretty obvious that girls prefer taller guys and no one minds if a girl says 'I want a man who is x tall' but if a guy says he prefers x thing he sounds shallow bla bla bla


I am aware that people cannot be perfect but to me it sounds like people sugarcoat to avoid messing with insecurities etc

I also know genetics is a part of it. B cups are small but not too small, C is average, D is big.

When I say flatchested I mean A-AA cup lol

Please no BS amd sugarcoating, just be honest if you are going to comment...

Ps: Also don't bring up personality, confidence, charisma and other crap. I am talking about looks",AskWomen,"Is dating as a flatchested woman really harder?I found a random article that compared being a flatchested woman to being a short man and said that we are often ignored / overlooked for this specific reason...

Half of the men on a dating site would pass if a girl had hardly any boobs and a good part of the girls would pass a short guy / a guy shorter than them.

It's not really shallow because you cannot control what you are attracted to.

Need some insight,"I have been married 10+ years, and happily with a some young children, successful life etc.  My wife and I had a rough summer, she was constantly asking for things that she knows I do not approve of or like.  I am a neat freak and for example she was wanting to tear our yard up and put in some arrangements that are hideous and she knows that I do not like.  Little things, but they kept coming up.  

Fast forward a few months and we had made a major investment in some property and I wanted to celebrate that night and she completely broke down and was crying because we had bought the property, which was something we had always dreamed about.  Her more than me as a matter of fact.

I was furious and lost my cool and we had a big argument and I didn't speak to her for a couple of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

One morning a month of so later a woman calls our house and accuses my wife of having an affair and my wife said she had no excuses.  She admitted that her and this guy had been talking and texting for a couple of months and that she needed some one to talk to.  After our fight and not talking for two weeks it had become some what physical with some kissing and petting.  This guy is 20 years older, almost 60 and literally looks like you put a mustache above that butthole of a dog.  He is huge, like weight wise not muscle wise.  A very ugly human being.  Im not going to win many beauty contests, but my wife and I are both attractive people.  And I did not marry up in the looks department, but my wife is fit and pretty.

I told her that I would be divorcing her, and she begged to try and work things out.  However, all of this was my fault and there wasn't much of the way of an apology.  I told her after a few weeks that I would like her to move out and that we needed to tell the kids why.  This infuriated her.  Her and I spoke with the kids and then she just stormed out of our residence and is living in what amounts to a two bedroom apartment.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have since had a change of heart after speaking with my kids and have tried to reconcile with her and explain that it would be much better for our children if we work through our issues as adults and come together and raise them.  Since she has left she flat out refuses to come back.  She says that I now have all the power and can throw her out at anytime.

Although you can tell she wants to and then looks away and says she isn't ready for that.  And that she needs time.  She tells me that she is embarrassed and sorry.

How fast to escalate?,"If you are dating guys using online dating in hopes of finding someone for a long term relationship, how many dates do you expect him to wait until he goes in for the kiss?

I am not an alpha male, so I already know women are not attracted to me physically. But I do possess the qualities that women want in a long term relationship, and I know when most women reach a certain age and want to settle down, they realize that alpha males are not gonna commit, so they instead look for guys with qualities that are good for a long term relationship, even if they are not physically attracted to these guys. I am one of those guys.

But since the girls I will be dating don't find me physically attractive, I am confused as to when I should go in for the kiss. Which date?

But I don't know if I should go for the kiss in the 2nd date or not. I know most girls will be dating other guys while dating me, and after a few dates they will pick the one they think is best.

Am I overreacting?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for quite a while now and I'm starting to feel like we shouldn't carry on seeing eachother. I appreciate my own space in a relationship and having time to do little things that I enjoy, but this seems almost impossible with my partner because of his constant need to have me do all of the things he wants to do when we're together, he'll even sulk if I walk to a different room, which, to me, seems a bit ridiculous. I'm finding it really hard to know if when he complains at me for not following him constantly if he's actually joking when he says he is, it's just something he appears to say when I look at him like he's being an asshole. 
   This really is just a small thing to be unsure about, but it's been going on for so long now that it's just making me feel down. As well as this, I just find him mean and rude, he will pick random fights with people while we're out and I don't understand why he thinks it's okay, he'll constantly make me feel shitty about things he's said is okay in the past, and he'll even make me out to be an idiot in front of other people for just saying something. 
   I don't know if I'm just insane or if this is something to be reasonably worried about, any advice would be appreciated.",AskWomen,"Am I overreacting?My boyfriend and I have been together for quite a while now and I'm starting to feel like we shouldn't carry on seeing eachother.

Eye lashes: What’s up with the obsession?,"Over the years I’ve been constantly talked to about my eyelashes, which happen to be a bit more longer and feminine than most people I know and meet. (Apparently I’ve had people be jealous over them? Especially my sisters) 

Me and a friend were stopped in the hallway to class by a teacher who wanted to comment on both of ours during the 3rd grade, and that’s when it really started to kick into high gear. Yesterday, as a matter of fact, I was chatting with a friend when she suddenly looked up and completely switched topics to comment on how mine looked. By now I’m used to it, but I never got a straight answer because nobody could explain.",AskWomen,"Eye lashes: What’s up with the obsession?Over the years I’ve been constantly talked to about my eyelashes, which happen to be a bit more longer and feminine than most people I know and meet.

Unsolicited compliments at the gym.,"What should I do?

I’ve been going to my gym consistently for about 6 years and I like to go in the weight room to work out. There’s a particular man, Caucasian in his late 40’s who slightly creeps me out. He always goes out of his way to interrupt me in my workout to say hello or strike up a conversation. He always gives me unsolicited comments like, “ you’re looking really fit lately and tighter than usual” or “hey haven’t seen you in a while” or “ you squat really well” and I always say hello back, thank you but I keep the conversation extremely short. 

Yesterday he stops me at the stairs as I’m about to run down to have a full blown conversation (which in all the I’ve been to the gym, never once have I indulged in a full conversation with him. He then proceeds to tell me he saw me out and about on the streets at a bar crawl. That he didn’t recognize me at first, but that I looked really good with makeup BUT that I didn’t need makeup. I smiled awkwardly to keep the conversation light - even though I was totally creeped out. He then tells me where he lives and where he works. Asks me if I like to drink in the Marina District and I say no. He then says to me  “Come by with your girlfriends and drink at my bar because I’ll  be there to take care of you.” 

I told my trainer friend at the gym about this interaction and how uncomfortable I felt. I made him go upstairs with me to point the individual out. 

Today, the creepy guy pulls my friend aside and tells him that he’s upset and complaining that I complained about him. That he’s uncomfortable about me being uncomfortable. 

What the hell? What do you gals think? Am I overreacting by being creeped out by him? Or that my gut feeling just tells me this guy is creepy? Is it wrong of me to complain about unsolicited invitations. I am just trying to work out at the gym. I wear big headphones, keep my head down and ignore people.

I am very confused," 

Ok this might be a bit drawn out but please help me decipher this. I have little to no experience with girls and am very confused on everything.

It started in early first semester (about october), I opened a Tinder and started swiping, so I matched with this girl and talked a little, found out we we had a class together but diff majors and everything so we exchanged snapchats and started talking on there for a little, found out she was into minor sports stuff and I guess that sort of turned me off to the convo because I figured we would have nothing in common (I was sort of wrong btw). One thing about me is that I don't like to talk about my interests because I'm not super confident in them, I usually make myself seem as vanilla as possible when I'm talking to people for the fist time. Due to this I think the og convo died.

Fast forward to this anime convention I went to with a couple of friends in november. I was taking pics and putting them on my sc story when later that night I got a text from this girl again after like a month of silence. She was like ""oh you watch \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" and I was like ""yea i watch \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" and the convo sort of spiraled out and I found out I had a good amount of stuff in common with her interest wise. Sci-fi, games, some anime, etc.

So november ends and so does the fall break, still have this one class together but we haven't met in person yet right. And I never really pushed her to meet in person because I felt it would be creepy if I straight out said that. So time passes and were still talking, still haven't asked her to hang out or anything. The semester ends and we don't hang out at all, still talking tho, apparently she lives like 10 mins from where my mom just moved. So i take the dive and in late december I ask her if she wants to do something over the break. She agrees. And I want you guys to know this is the first time I've ever spoken to a girl like this, in hs my face would turn red just from talking to a person but I've progressed as a person now I only blush deep red sometimes when I talk to girls. I am needless to say very inexperienced with this kind of thing I'm just an anime nerd who spent all of middle school and hs watching anime and working, I'm not necessarily fat but I'm not skinny either, I'm not so confident about myself to be concrete.

So my bother comes home form the navy, I'm a triplet and I want to hang out with him because next time I'll see him will be god knows when. I extend the hang out date until the breaks almost over. She asks me if we're even gonna do it but I just say no eventually because stuff got too hectic. She says she'e be cool with hanging out at school so we don't do anything over break.

After a few weeks of talking after second semester begins I ask her if she wants to hang out and she recommends a coffee place by campus. So we meet up there and this is the first time I've actually seen her in person and I'll assume it's the same for her. So I think she's sort of out of my league tbh, learn she was captain of track in hs and stuff so shes in shape and shes also pretty cool guys. But she actually seems to be enjoying herself on the hang out thing, shes laughing and I'm cool just being there guys it was sort of an ethereal experience. So I'm retarded, me just sitting there like an idiot I order before she gets to the place and when she comes she orders and we grab some seats etc. She tells me on the walk back that she would be cool with us doing something like that again. Holy shit guys what a fucking confidence boost.

So again I'm retarded. I'm so slow at asking her she asks me to hang out this time, we go for pizza and again another cool hang out thing were doing. One of those things where you lose track of time you know. So it ends around roughly the same ending as the last thing, also I'm not calling them dates because we're not dating. And we're still talking on sc, just text tho a always. I ask her to hang out and watch a movie, after some talking we narrow it down to watch it in my dorm (I wasn't sure about this at my room because I mean how could I be) so we watch it. I sit in the most awkward way on my bed, like right on the edge, but so does she and this is def because i was holding the laptop on my lap (I leaned it towards her tho I'm not an asshole). So that ends again.

The most recent time she asked me if I could meet her friends saying they wanted to meet me. Now why the fuck is she talking about me with her friends, at the movie she mentioned that if I wanted I could hang with her and her friends to drink and stuff so maybe that was it? So that happens and I'm awkward as hell, its one other girl and a room full of guys. They're all chill, nice people but I'm on edge because I suck at situations like this. So I stand int the same spot for like 30+ mins before she asks me if I want to sit down (we're in a dorm room so they're small and this one is crowded). Night ends, walk her back to her dorm and go back to my dorm,

This all happened in 4 weeks, each weekend one event happened. So now we're in the present. I have a few questions, she always replies and continues the convo but she takes forever to respond to my texts, like an hour-2 at a time normally and I usually do the same with her sometimes to make it seem like I'm busy and not too eager to talk but also because I am a busy person. Recently I was texting her and she opened it while I was typing but closed it while I was typing and didn't respond for like an hour until after that. Does anyone have any idea why she did this. Idk if shes interested in me, I mean shes cool with hanging out and we've had a sustainable convo for like 4 months with questions coming both ways. But she also takes forever to respond and she doesn't care what we do when we hang out apparently, when I ask her what she wants to do she just says it doesn't matter and that shes fine with whatever. What does this mean guys how do I interpret her? Thanks for reading...",AskWomen,"I am very confused

One of those things where you lose track of time you know. So it ends around roughly the same ending as the last thing, also I'm not calling them dates because we're not dating. And we're still talking on sc, just text tho a always. I ask her to hang out and watch a movie, after some talking we narrow it down to watch it in my dorm (I wasn't sure about this at my room because I mean how could I be) so we watch it. I sit in the most awkward way on my bed, like right on the edge, but so does she and this is def because i was holding the laptop on my lap (I leaned it towards her tho I'm not an asshole). So that ends again.

The most recent time she asked me if I could meet her friends saying they wanted to meet me. Now why the fuck is she talking about me with her friends, at the movie she mentioned that if I wanted I could hang with her and her friends to drink and stuff so maybe that was it? So that happens and I'm awkward as hell, its one other girl and a room full of guys. They're all chill, nice people but I'm on edge because I suck at situations like this. So I stand int the same spot for like 30+ mins before she asks me if I want to sit down (we're in a dorm room so they're small and this one is crowded). Night ends, walk her back to her dorm and go back to my dorm,

This all happened in 4 weeks, each weekend one event happened. So now we're in the present. I have a few questions, she always replies and continues the convo but she takes forever to respond to my texts, like an hour-2 at a time normally and I usually do the same with her sometimes to make it seem like I'm busy and not too eager to talk but also because I am a busy person. Recently I was texting her and she opened it while I was typing but closed it while I was typing and didn't respond for like an hour until after that. Does anyone have any idea why she did this. Idk if shes interested in me, I mean shes cool with hanging out and we've had a sustainable convo for like 4 months with questions coming both ways. But she also takes forever to respond and she doesn't care what we do when we hang out apparently, when I ask her what she wants to do she just says it doesn't matter and that shes fine with whatever. What does this mean guys how do I interpret her? Thanks for reading..."

",AskWomen,"I don’t wear make up daily. What do you think of me? And does wearing make up get easier?I don’t wear make up daily. I’ll make sure my brows and lashes have dye on them, but I will be natural face and hair. 

Do other women think I’m confident? That I should make more of an effort? Or something else? I just don’t make the effort. When I had bar jobs I did.

How do you deal with mens' stare?,"First of all, I just wanna describe my experience today and how I feel about my inability to control my gaze. If this kind of stuff makes you uncomfortable, I apologize.

Well let's get to the point. I noticed it, I consciously suppressed it (NONOONONONONONO), after I closed my eyes suddenly all those resistance is gone (SHIISHISHITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHSIHTISTIHSIHT). it felt like some random dude got control of the joystick to my eyes.  I feel guilty and feel like a shit after I failed to contain it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always consciously reminded myself not to do that but I always failed. Sometimes I succeeded suppressing the urge but sometimes I failed. I beat myself up for these and sometimes I really want to poke my eyes out.

Accidentally creepily stared at a girl who's a friend of my friend. Did I just ruin my friendship.,"For context I'm the kinda guy who gets super paranoid about things so I'm not sure if  I'm overthinking this or not.  Anyway I'm really good friends with this girl.  This girl is super cool, genuine, and funny and is an all around A+ friend.   So I'm just chilling in this girl's apartment with her and her roommates doing my homework.  I'm spending about half my time talking about stuff and half my time doing my own thing.  Anyway I'm thinking about something funny and totally space out when one of my friend's roommates makes eye contact with me.  Even worse is I had a dumb smile on my face.  I immediately look away but I think she thinks I was creepily staring at her while smiling.  Anyway to make matters worse as me and my friend were walking out to do something and she was saying something to her other roommate, I spaced out again.  Somehow with my terrible luck my body and head was turned directly at her and this time I was standing.  I immediately turned around again.  She might have not seen me but given how I was oriented I think she may have.  Not sure though.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway normally I wouldn't have cared at all.  But my friend is really close with her roommates and I'm afraid this girl is going to tell my friend how much of a creep I am and how I stare at girls and smile at them or whatever.  If that is so I feel like that would totally ruin and my friendship with this girl and I don't want that because like I said she's a pretty cool person.  So please let me know if I'm overthinking this or if there is anything I can do to explain or something.  Thanks!",AskWomen,"Accidentally creepily stared at a girl who's a friend of my friend.

It never ended up happening because one time he had blue balls and was asking me to send him nudes and asked if he thinks we would do sexual stuff if we hung out alone. I said no because we are both loyal to my best friend and told him not to talk to me like that again. He said he was so sorry immediately after he realised he was uncomfortable and told me not to tell his fiancé straight away. I said I would not if he swore he would never do this again. He did and I put it behind me. Now I am finding out he has been continuously lying to her about exchanges with women and although he has yet to physically cheat he still makes passes at me. I have no proof, the first encounter happened almost a month ago and honestly if my friend ditched me I would be sad but I would understand why.

Opinion Needed! How I would introduce or approach a woman im looking to date.,"I would like a woman's opinion on how I would introduce myself and possibly ask for their number.

So this is more torward meeting women that ive never met before, of course its alot easier when youve known someone for a while or while at school. I also believe its not okay to ask a girl out or flirt while in the workplace. I have a ton of respect for women as a man, and I feel like I might be too nice.

So to start off I would probably walk up to a woman and start off by saying hi, then maybe commenting on whatever is going on at the moment (grocery store, concert, etc) then eventually asking if she has a boyfriend. I would then proceed to introduce myself by giving my name (i would probably expect her to then give me her name) then proceed to ask for her number and that we should set up a date or something. Then to make things less weird I would probably walk away right after and continue to do whatever I was doing. 

Im not the type of guy that dates alot of women, i actually find myself to be the very opposite of desperate and just looking for a down to earth woman.

I used to feel relatively good about myself but since getting into a relationship I’ve found my opinions on my body, face and general attractiveness decrease and more insecurities and worries creep up in my mind (stupid stuff like how he looks at other women especially after a few foot in mouth comments like one about how his co-worker looks ‘great’ in her uniform and others about my appearance- e.g. your ass is getting smaller, i’ve fucked hotter women than you, you’re a downgrade etc; however these comments are not as bad as they seem as they were more slipped in to conversation rather than outright and I know he really does love me)

Can you give consent if you black out?,"This happened in June, but I've just forced myself not to think about it. Recently however I just cant stop over analyzing the situation

We were at my friends farm having a bonfire and everyone was drinking except me (there were 4 of us). I had taken a xanax during the day and I took half another one during the night. 

Everyone kept trying to get me to take a shot of whiskey, but I didn't want to because drinking on xanax makes me black out.

I was there with my best friend, her boyfriend, and a mutual friend (call him Ron). So i was like, wth, nothings gonna happen im with my friends and I'm only gonna take one.

I woke up the next day on the couch with Ron confused as hell. I thought we just passed out and thought nothing of it. (Wore a dress so, ya know, wasnt obvious what had happened)

He wouldnt even talk to me, let alone look at me. I was so confused and figured I'd ended up blacking out and did something stupid.

We stayed over at my friend's boyfriend's house so we got up and went into his room to figure out plans. 

When it was just me and my friend she told me that i kissed Ron. I have no recollection of this at all. So i asked her what else happened? She just said yall went to the other room. I dont remember that either.

Later we went back to his farm and Ron and her were talking, apparently he felt bad because he felt like he took advantage of me.

He still wont talk to me, I dont really want to talk to him I just want to know what happened. It makes me sick to think about it, but i put myself in that situation.

Lately i just feel disgusted by what happened. I have no idea how 'sober' i looked. I know benzos slow down basically everything and for me personally you can tell. I dont know how i was acting when I blacked out.

It cant be considered assault if i put myself in that sitaution, right? He was only drunk at the most as he hadnt taken anything.

I dont want to press charges or anything, I just feel disgusting and wonder how much is my fault, and how much is his. 

I do remember for a fact I told them I would black out if I drank, but in everyones defense they drinking.

What birth control next?,"Hello, I’m a 33 year old woman about to get my Paraguard removed on Monday. I can’t decide what to do next and would like to hear other women’s opinions. I’ve been in some form of birth control since I was 17 and I had my paraguard put in at 23. I’ve never had any terrible reactions to any birth control but stopped using hormonal birth control because I wanted to let my body not have hormones. I’m having it removed because it’s about that time to change it.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years and we’ve relied on my birth control so while I like the option of maybe just winging it without any birth control I don’t think it’s fair to change our whole relationship dynamic. He wants me to decide but I know he’d support me no matter what.

So friends, what do you think? Have you gone from iud to nothing? Have you or your relationships been affected negatively by that decision? Do you think it’s crazy to change the dynamic? Should I just stick with paraguard? Do you love your other form of birth control? Help me out with any information.

"Do you find it tacky or cheap when someone gives you food as a gift? If not, what is a goodie that you’d really appreciate receiving?","My mom has always given homemade goodies as gifts to people like our teachers, pastors, etc. during the holiday season. She always made sure to do something special and everyone always seemed to look forward to it. It was relatively inexpensive (compared to buying each of them a gift) and it seemed to be something that all the recipients appreciated. 

I was considering doing something like this for mine and my boyfriend’s coworkers but I wasn’t sure how they’d view it. I’m mainly worried about how my boyfriend’s coworkers would view it. He just started working as a credit analyst for a bank and I’d hate to send him with a gift that his coworkers would view as tacky. 


I LOVE to cook/bake and he’s taken one of my desserts to a work potluck before and came home with rave review so I feel confident gifting my food haha. Between the two of us there are less than 10 people that I’d be baking for so I have a lot of wiggle room to get really creative with what I’m making. I was thinking maybe gourmet cupcakes or something? I don’t want to do fudge or Oreo balls since that’s something most people make around this time of year.

Opinions from women who dated older men as a minor?,"The background is that I am a man who dated a 16 year old girl when I was 27.

also, this might be a long jumbled story so feel free to skip to the end, but I’m a bit overwhelmed so that’s why.

I’m (F) 21 years old and until today I never had an orgasm or even tried to masturbate. 
Apparently, almost every girl has masturbated while in their teens. I didn’t know this was something so common because it’s been a taboo for such a long time and I feel like finally now people are talking about it and being more open. While this is great for women all around, it made me very insecure about my own sexuality. Because I never really felt like masturbating I never did it, but since a few years I started to realise this wasn’t quite normal. More and more (girl)friends of mine told me about orgasms and toys and masturbating and I often kept my mouth shut because I was too embarrassed.
I have had a boyfriend for a few years now and I also didn’t want to embarrass him by telling my friends I never came. I spoke with my boyfriend about me not wanting sex that regularly and if I maybe could be asexual (I really didn’t want this because I don’t want to miss out). He’s very understanding about it but it still sucks.

A week ago I heard about this toy, the satisfyer, online. I started to read more about it and lots of women said this was a great toy if you’ve never had an orgasm before. My concern was that I had never even felt horny or masturbated before, so I questioned if it would be logical for me to get a sex toy, someone so vanilla? I did it anyway and it just came in the mail. I was like 80% sure this would just be another let down for me, because I feel so little when I have sex. Turns out it wasn’t. I had to switch to the shower halfway through because I was worried it was gonna be a big mess. 
I think I had like 5 orgasms but I’m not sure. As I said I never felt that much when having sex, so everything I felt was more than I ever felt. 
The first time I think I came was when I felt like I was having a big sneeze, which is like the common thing people say about orgasms. I was so startled by this sneeze feeling I stopped immediately. When I continued I felt like I couldn’t control my muscles anymore and my legs started to move whenever they wanted, which is also something they say about orgasms I think? Or at least, it’s what you see in porn, the girls all react very effusively, something I always thought was fake. It also got very wet and I think maybe I squirted (which is just pee I heard?).
The latter few times were in the shower so I didn’t hold in, because I felt like I was doing that before. I was sitting in the shower and these times my legs wanted to stretch and my muscles wanted to be flexed all the time? Which was really weird to me because I’ve never seen something like it. Also my breathing got heavier and as much as I didn’t want to be that sterotypical porn girl, I almost felt like that.

The reason why I’m not sure if these were orgasms or just enjoying the masturbation is because, like I said, I never had any experience with stuff like this. Also I feel like people always end with a climax, like you see in movies. I eventually decided to just stop because my clit was a bit swollen and very sensitive, but I didn’t feel like I had that feeling people have when they orgasm and they are immediately done; I could’ve gone on.

I dont think my girlfriend is honest with me about her past.,"First off, please dont give me maybe she dosnt want you to know her past. I really dont care, our relationship was built on lies from the beginning which I wont get into. I have forgiven her for the past but I feel this is reasonable for me to ask.

My girlfriend has told me her number is 14. But because I felt she was cheating on me I snooped through her phone. I was kind of right, she was talking to another guy, nothing happened but they were flirting. But inbetween all that I found out her and her girlfriends were talking about their numbers and she said in was in the 20s.

When I confronted her about this she said she just said her number was more to her friends to make her sound better then she was. Given her number of 14 is already 4 or 5 more guys then her friends (next biggest to 21was 9) I dont know why she would lie about another 6 or 7? Do girls lie to their friends about how many guys they've slept with? Or is she just not telling me the right amount?

I really dont care, our relationship was built on lies from the beginning which I wont get into. I have forgiven her for the past but I feel this is reasonable for me to ask.

My girlfriend has told me her number is 14. But because I felt she was cheating on me I snooped through her phone. I was kind of right, she was talking to another guy, nothing happened but they were flirting. But inbetween all that I found out her and her girlfriends were talking about their numbers and she said in was in the 20s.

When I confronted her about this she said she just said her number was more to her friends to make her sound better then she was. Given her number of 14 is already 4 or 5 more guys then her friends (next biggest to 21was 9) I dont know why she would lie about another 6 or 7? Do girls lie to their friends about how many guys they've slept with? Or is she just not telling me the right amount?

Thanks 😁"

I'm right....amn't I?,"Went to a pub last night with (all male) friends, a random tourist approaches us and joins in in our conversation.

I politely refuse, given that she is far more intoxicated than I was and head home. On the way home I am repeatedly and roundly chastised by friends for being a ""fucking moron"" because I didn't ""seal the deal"".

Feeling insecure about the lower regions. So I have to ask how does half a ruler stack up?,"Recently I have been feeling down after I tried something different with my long distance girlfriend (4 year relationship). I had a her buy a toy to use on herself while we Cammed. But unbeknownst to me the toy she bought was about an inch longer along with being girth-ier than I was. To not be a poor sport an as to go along with the whole experience I thought I would try to put my insecurities aside for her pleasure ( her sex drive is higher than mine). But seeing her use it on herself and really go at it with the with the toy, whilst having to watch made me feel more emasculated than I have ever felt in my whole life. 

(True story that actually happened to me before, I had a girl once was about to have sex with ask me ""is that it? I expected more from a black guy your height"")

 Because it seemed like she loved it going deeper than I could have ever imagined to have gone, and unlike when we have penetrative sex she actually came quite easily (something I can't say I haven't made her do but, not at the speed in which she did).

But after she was finished and she realized that maybe something was off with me * ( maybe I couldn't hide the fact that I was heart broken) * she stated that she loved having sex with me and that I was great *all the pleasantries *. 

But I cant shake the feeling that I am not adequate for her or quite frankly in general. I had the same issue with former partners. So to bring my rambling full circle. Is six inches not adequate?

Tips/safety advice for being a sugar baby?,"So, I made an account on the seeking website the other day and within an hour of my profile getting approved I had messages from 16 different men. And then more after that. I chatted with a couple and then deactivated my account because I'm not sure if it is something I really want to do and I don't want to get scammed, used, lied to, etc. The extra money would be nice and some of them weren't terrible looking either! I just want to be safe and protect myself and know what I'm getting into before I choose one, or two if they don't want to be exclusive. 

What I'm wondering is:
1) How do I make sure these guys are truthful in what they want/how much they want to give and who they even actually are? 
2) Is there a typical vetting process? How do I know if they are lieing? I guess I wouldn't until I find out?
3) Do I ask for the money up front? I was offered anything from $500/date to start to $2500/month for 2 meetings a week. 
4) Do you do full background checks on the guys before you ever meet them?

I had some say in their original message that would provide proof of income and clean STD screenings upon first meet. I assume that would be something that's expected from any of them?

I'm terrified of being raped, hurt, etc but do you find it to be fairly safe?

"are my anxious thoughts normal relationship doubts, or something to truly be concerned over?","(originally posted this in r/TwoXChromosomes and r/relationships but didn't get much attention, so i figured i'd update and post here and see what you all think!)

apologies in advance for this long post!! i know i've talked about this a bit before on here and i guess i still want to hear some outsider thoughts.

for some background, i'm 25f and my s/o is 27m. we've been together just over 10 months now. we got together mid-january and it wasn't long after that that i knew that this person would be my partner for life. through all the months that followed, nothing ever, ever made me doubt that or even question it. i knew it deep in my gut that my future is with him and we would build a life together. i truly believe the way we met and ended up together was nothing short of fate/the universe/god guiding us together, cheesy as it may be (and i would be happy to share that story if anyone is curious, lol).

then, around halloween, just after the tree of life shooting - which was on my mind a lot at the time, i began having these intense anxiety dreams for about 4-5 days straight, multiple times a night, that either a car accident or shooting would happen to one of my loved ones (parents, sibling, relatives, and s/o). in the dreams where something happened to my s/o, i woke up in a complete panic that i would never see him again in the afterlife (for some more background - i grew up christian and still believe in god, but have a lot of problems w/ the church as an institution and don't regularly attend anymore or like organized religion, am very liberal-minded, am bisexual, and don't really believe that a loving god would not bring all people into heaven with him in the afterlife - i guess my afterlife beliefs are fairly universalist?). i see car accidents a lot on my 45 min drive to/from work, and i know the shooting (and shootings) have been troubling me as much as ever, so i feel like that made its way into my subconscious and caused me to have these awful dreams.

ever since i had those dreams, i feel like i've been reassessing our relationship. my s/o is agnostic leaning towards ""probably no god"" which never bothered me until recently - even now it doesn't really bother me much because we have all the same values and life goals, despite them being informed differently. i never, even before this relationship, thought my s/o having different beliefs than i would would be a dealbreaker or anything, and i'm still not sure that it is. we talked about this after i had those dreams and he comforted me, said he is willing to go to church with me whenever i ask (although like i said...i don't attend regularly anymore), is willing to introduce religion to our children but leave it their choice, etc. which i agree with is the best option, whether we shared the same beliefs or not - i know even if my partner did share my beliefs our children may not, and it's not like it's something i could control. i'm not sure why it's been on my mind so much that the two of us don't share the same beliefs when i have tons and tons of close friends who believe different things than i do, or the same things as him, and it doesn't bother me at all. is this an anxious thought i am fixating on or something to truly be concerned over?

some other things that have been on my mind recently are that our love languages are quite different. for me, i love physical affection and words of affirmation. for my s/o, quality time and gift giving are what make him happy. my s/o is not great at expressing emotions (due to some toxic masculinity mindsets in his family growing up) - something he's been open about with me since day 1 - and has definitely gotten better with it over time, but i still feel like i am always asking for and needing more. i know i can be a fairly needy person, and he'll step up and do more when i ask, but has jokingly said before that ""nothing ever seems like it's good enough for you"" and that i ""quantify our love"" and sometimes i worry that these needs will go unmet - like, i wish i didn't have to ask to snuggle or get a kiss out of nowhere, i wish he would just do it on his own more often, you know? his ""a lot"" is often my ""just barely enough"". sometimes there will be weeks where he does everything i need without my prompting, but after a while it kind of goes back to me asking once again. i know he's gone out of his comfort zone for me, but i also feel like it shouldn't be an issue or something that needs to be asked fairly often to give your partner what they need to feel loved.

the other things that have been on my mind is that he complains a fair amount. usually when we get together after work we'll both talk about our days and vent, but i feel like his take is always rather negative and it's not often that something positive happens. he has a pretty tough, physically/mentally demanding job and a hard-to-please boss so he's usually exhausted by the end of the work day. i have suggested to him before to look for a different job that he enjoys (and that pays him better! he makes a little less than i do and i KNOW he is doing way more than i do at my job and way more qualified and skilled at it. he wants to hold this job down for over a year before he moves on, though - he's been there since april after the last company he was at suddenly went under). i am a pretty positive and optimistic person so i'll usually ask something like ""what was your favorite part of the day?"" or ""what's something good that happened?"" and half the time he'll answer honestly (and it's usually ""getting to spend time with you"" lol) and the other half he'll say ""just let me complain."" it truly doesn't wear on me, i am the person many of my friends come to to vent with too so i take no issue with it, but i do wish he were less critical and more positive about some things and wish more things brought him happiness.

we get along really well - we were actually set up by a mutual friend who thought we would get along well together. we've had arguments but are always able to talk things out and see each other's side, we are always able to compromise if need be and reach a good conclusion where we're both satisfied. we're respectful to one another and put each other and family first. we have the same goals in life and the same values. we have similar interests and enjoy our time together, whether we're doing an activity only one of us likes or one that we both enjoy. we never run out of things to talk about and love learning about new things from each other and telling stories to one another. we are both kind, loving, passionate people. i know he loves me wholeheartedly and i feel the same. i see how much he loves me in everything he does.

my s/o makes me so, so happy and i still see a future with him. but i'm worried that while these things may not bother me now, down the line in 15, 25 years, i may have issues with them that i don't now. i will say honestly that i have always been an anxious/worrisome person, and am going to see a therapist next week since my anxiety has worsened a lot recently - i don't want to make a decision based on these doubts i'm having before talking it out with a professional. i never worried about this before, and i feel like the anxiety from the dreams i had have seeped over into my actual life and haven't left me alone since.

a doctor of mine told me recently that she isn't able to make a decision on her future with a romantic partner until they've been through every season together - a full year. we will have been officially together for one year in february, so i'm hoping that after doing some therapy these next few months and going through all four seasons i will feel more confident about our relationship. i just feel so lost right now though - i never doubted any of this before, i never had these worries, and for the past few weeks it has all but consumed me. i feel like i am in a constant state of flux, sure of something one minute and doubting everything the next. is this what a quarter-life crisis feels like??

**tl;dr:** i guess what i really want to know is, are these doubts/questions normal? is this something everyone goes through at this point in a relationship? or is it something i truly should be concerned over? what advice can you give? how do i get the confidence back that i once had before my anxiety took over all my thoughts? this is the longest relationship i have ever been in so i feel a little lost at sea, if you will. i'm afraid to bring up these thoughts to my s/o out of fear of worrying him. i know he has no doubts and is planning for a future together - and i still am, too.

How much money is too much for a Christmas present.,"I recently started a new job, and I have a little disposable income. I'd like to get my best friend back home something nice, but I don't want to make her feel awkward.

I'd like to spend a hundred or so pounds, but I don't want her to feel like she ows me. She isn't well off (probably borderline poverty), and I was thinking about just giving her a cash sum, to spend how she likes.

"Ladies, how can I engage you better on dating apps?","I've recently gotten back into the dating scene and matches on dating apps the last 2 months or so have been pretty... Flat, I guess. There's always been matches that I just can't start a conversation with, but lately they've far, far outweighed matches that I can chat with enough to actually set up a date. I don't feel like I'm doing anything different than I used to, when I had an easier time getting dates. I try opening with something from their profile, or at least something interesting enough to start some sort of conversation. I try to lead things into territory where we're actually talking back and forth. But 9 times out of 10, I hit a wall with dry responses that leave me with nothing but asking another question and turning the chat into an interview.

So, I figured I should go right to the source. What are some ways that your matches engage you on dating apps? What are some openers or questions that would actually get you talking? If I feel like things are about to hit that wall, is there anything I could do or say to prevent it, or is it just disinterest and I should cut my losses?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

"Is It Okay To Lie To A Women To Get Her To Sleep With Me? (Disclaimer: I think it's wrong, my girlfriend disagrees)","So, I asked my girlfriend this question, *thinking* it was rhetorical.

""Say I go into a bar and start flirting with a woman. She's physically attractive, and I want to have fun, mutually agreeable sex with her. I lie and tell her I'm a pilot (or a billionaire, or that I have a yacht) so that she'll sleep with me. Is this unethical?""

Now, to me, this is clearly unethical. I asked this question as a rhetorical setup for a follow-up question. But then she shocked me by saying ""Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, if she's just sleeping with you because you're a pilot, then you both got what you wanted, right?""

Now I'm confused. So I decided to ask the internet. What does the internet think?

Note - my girlfriend already made the points:

""I wouldn't sleep with anyone just because they said they're a pilot""

""Most girls aren't going to go home with a random guy they meet in a bar no matter what"" 

""If a girl believes that without any proof, she must be really dumb""

To which I respond: I don't care. I'm setting up a hypothetical scenario to suss out the ethics of dating.

Advice for not being a control freak at work?,"I work in marketing at a mid-level company and I have been on my particular team the longest. I'm in a mid-level position and not directly managing anyone.

How do I tell my friend I don't want to be a bridesmaid?," I have a friend whom I know wants to ask me to be a bridesmaid for a Disney wedding that may happen sometime in the near future, and she might even ask me to be a maid of honor. I think she would probably be a sweet, gracious bride and she's a dear friend. Despite this, I really don't want to be a bridesmaid period for anyone ever on any planet. I really, really don't enjoy dressing up, weddings, get-togethers, any sort of planning, shopping (for dresses or wedding dresses of any kind), and any number of things that go along with it. The idea of a wedding, and getting ready for a wedding, in any capacity bores me to tears. Also idea of having to get photos of myself and shopping makes me feel incredibly anxious, miserable, and uncomfortable. In fact, I get upset when people take photos of me. In so many ways, I just don't want to do it. It would be about as enjoyable as sticking my head in an oven, and I don't want to do that to her or myself. I know she has friends that would enjoy the process much more.  


I sorta resent the expectation that just because my friend is choosing to get married to her SO that I'm expected to be involved in any other way than just being happy for her choice to get married.  I would rather just show up as a guest and support her that way. I don't think the bridesmaid thing is, or should be, as big of a deal as it is. She'll just have to accept that I'm not that person. I love and support her in other ways that I'm more comfortable with. Anyway, her wedding is about her and her SO. The rest of it is just extraneous, including bridesmaids.  


How am I going to tell her no? I don't know.

My girlfriend is mad at me cause I fail to show my care towards her,"Hello ladies, 

&amp;#x200B;

I need  tips/advices on how I keep my girl. I am in a long distance relationship with my GF since past couple of months, we were together before and then we broke up and got back together again. It was great in the beginning, but now we fight every other day. Main topic of our fights is she thinks I don't care enough about her.  We argued again today and now we decided to take a break from each other for couple of days for our own sanity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons she think I'm not a good boy friend,

\- She recently started swimming lessons and she has been going there every day, after day 2, her swimming instructor  sent her forward messages on whatsApp. She told me about it and I got concerned, she asked me what to do, I said forward me that message first and I looked into that message and it was just some funny video clip from Bollywood, nothing bad, I asked her to ask other people in her class if he forwards messages to them too, she asked one of her male friends who introduced her to this swimming class and he said no he didn't receive any messages. Later she just blocked him on WhatsApp, and she continued her swimming course, I asked her the next day, how she was and how was the swimming and she said all good, and thats all we talked about on topic of swimming that day. She got pissed at me today  saying why didn't I ask more info about the instructor, I said I asked you how was swimming and you said it was good, which makes it clear for me that he didn't bother you. But her point is she thinks I don't care enough about her and ask it to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Her swimming hat tore and she had to buy a new one, she said to me on phone she will have to buy a new swimming hat. I said  ok, she then bought couple of days later and all was good, she then got pissed at me today that I didn't care enough to ask her if she bought the hat or not. I honestly didn't think it was that big of deal that I need to ask her about it, I honestly forgot about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- She also got pissed that I don't ask her enough about her diet, since she is working out (swimming). I told her eat healthy food, food with more protein, she says I need to give her suggestions on what to eat and all, I said I would if you ask me, but her point is that I should initiate all this talk by myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- She was upset with me before that I don't ask her about what she had for lunch and breakfast. I thought she would be fine since she lives with her parents and her mum gives her packed lunch everyday.  I mentioned it to her but she says I need to ask her too, to show that I care and since then I have been asking about what she ate everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

All these issues seems too small, but I'm finding it really difficult. I really love her and care about her. There are lots of such issues we face.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first real relationship and I have been living alone since past 8 years so I'm not very good with this stuff. I'm trying my best to keep checking on her, but I always seem to fail. How shall I deal with this whole situation? I really want our relationship to workout.

Would you stay with someone who doesn’t want to marry you when you do want to get married?,"My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years. The last time we had a serious fight, he brought up that he wanted to ask me to marry him.

I’m so confused about what he wants. I’m starting to think he said that just to keep me around because he thought I was going to leave him. I can’t help but feel disappointed and a little bitter every time he changes the topic. I got so excited, and it feels like I did for nothing.

Questions regarding the “women only date assholes” issue...,"Hello ladies of Reddit!

So here’s a bit of backstory that leads into my questions...

I’m a man in my late 20’s and based on my personal experience, I’ve always believed the “nice guys finish last” thing to be absolute BS. 

Ever since I started dating I’ve made a conscientious effort to be polite, considerate, and an overall good quality guy (this is not my imagination, it has been validated by pretty much everyone who knows me at a personal level) and I’ve always dated women who have been very intelligent, attractive, pleasant, etc. In other words, I’ve never “settled” for someone whom I didn’t want to be with under the premise that I was a decent person and I wasn’t being paid attention to because of this.

Now, I’m an older brother to two sisters who are in their early and mid twenties... they’re both absolutely beautiful (both are paid profesional models) they’re highly driven, intelligent, etc. I have no doubt that they both could have their pick of any guy they wanted to date... BUT, they both have always dated assholes. Now it’s valid to note that I’m being very objective and I’m sincerely not speaking from a perspective of “no one is good enough for my sister”, but realistically and for the most part, they’ve always dated dudes that have just been uneducated, impolite, selfish, inconsiderate douchebags... by ANY standard. 

They both complain to me how they’re not treated with romance or consideration, etc.

Here’s where my questions come in... if any of you have been in this situation, my first question to you is “why?” Why date people whom you obviously know are not good for you, and beyond that, that you know are waaaaaaaay below what you deserve?

On a more personal note, what would you, as a woman, like your older brother to do in this situation? Should I make comments on the obvious? What questions can I ask to better understand them?

Now, obviously there’s never been any sort of physical abuse or anything of the sort, otherwise I would’ve 100% stepped in, but beyond that, I’m just wondering f if it’s my place to say anything at all regarding whom they decide to date. My main concern is that if I step in to say something they’ll feel alienated and stop talking to me about their relationships and personal lives. 

I’ll welcome any comments that any of you may have regarding the situation as well as any follow up questions that could help with clarification on the situation.

Now it’s valid to note that I’m being very objective and I’m sincerely not speaking from a perspective of “no one is good enough for my sister”, but realistically and for the most part, they’ve always dated dudes that have just been uneducated, impolite, selfish, inconsiderate douchebags... by ANY standard. 

They both complain to me how they’re not treated with romance or consideration, etc.

Here’s where my questions come in... if any of you have been in this situation, my first question to you is “why?” Why date people whom you obviously know are not good for you, and beyond that, that you know are waaaaaaaay below what you deserve?

On a more personal note, what would you, as a woman, like your older brother to do in this situation? Should I make comments on the obvious? What questions can I ask to better understand them?

Now, obviously there’s never been any sort of physical abuse or anything of the sort, otherwise I would’ve 100% stepped in, but beyond that, I’m just wondering f if it’s my place to say anything at all regarding whom they decide to date. My main concern is that if I step in to say something they’ll feel alienated and stop talking to me about their relationships and personal lives. 

I’ll welcome any comments that any of you may have regarding the situation as well as any follow up questions that could help with clarification on the situation.

Thanks in advance for your insight, questions, and comments!"

MIL Long Term Plan To Steal Inheritance,"Our (adult siblings) dad is a small time real estate investor, and I am worried our MIL is slowly stealing what he had always planned to give to us.

He is getting older and will probably die before her.

She already got a property in her name.

She keeps telling our dad to put money in savings, instead of investing in property and signing it in his and our names. This makes it easier for her to get the money if he dies.

She even tries to tell my younger sister to be grateful she is letting her stay in OUR DAD'S house!!

She walks away with everything in his name when he dies, minus what's on his will, so it is doubly frustrating.

I don't know what to think about this situation because she is not doing anything illegal (?), and in reality it's not the money that's the problem - we are all earning enough money.

"How to avoid ""creeping people out""?","I know I'm off to a bad start with the title here, but hear me out.

My roommate texts me he's almost there, so I go outside to look for him and bam. They lock the door on me. I knew 90% of the guys in there, and had even left my jacket and hat inside. Dude comes to the door saying how he doesnt know me yada yada, one thing leads to another and he said I was creeping a girl out and proceeded to shove me onto my ass on (what I later found out to be his) porch.

"To tell him, or not","I went out a few months ago with my newly single friend. We went to a nightclub, before we even got there we were both very drunk.

&amp;#x200B;

She was newly single and wanted to party, i am in a loving, committed relationship with the man of my dreams. We had been together for a year

&amp;#x200B;

The night went on, we were drinking heaps. I flirted with this man i knew from my last job, i dont know him very well, he got very touchy feely but i didnt think all that much of it being so drunk i just rolled with it. At one point he kissed my cheek and i wasnt trying to encourage it, but i didnt stop him either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ran into some other friends and didnt see him again, my other group of friends left so i kept drinking and walking around the club by myself. i couldnt find the friend i came with and wanted to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a man aproach me and ask if i had a boyfriend, i said no. I dont know why i said it and am disgusted with myself, he pulled me towards his seat and pulled me on top of him, i immediately got off and walked away trying to find my friend so we could leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

I havent told my partner any of this. And i am sick with shame and guilt over the way i behaved. Its not me at all.

I have a big question...,"I want to start this off by saying I obviously need to see a therapist, and I plan on it, I just haven’t been yet. 

So let’s start off with the story. One night, 4ish years ago, I went to a guy’s house that I had been pretty close with for many years, with one of my girl friends. We decided to pick up some beers at Walmart and just hung out at his apartment. We were talking and somehow my boobs got brought up. And my girl friend was saying that I would show my guy friend my boobs, because they were perfect, and he was always curious. And I was sn’t very fond of the idea, but I was also proud of my boobs. So I took my shirt off. And my girl friend was like no your bra too! I was a pretty conservative person. Only had kissed and had sex with one guy at this point in my life. So i said no and they were like it’s fine! They look great just do it! So I did. But  put my hands over them. And I looked over and saw a big canvas of the guy we were with and his fiancé. (I know this is all very wrong) and I was like uhhhh... so he went over and laid the canvas down so we couldn’t see it anymore. 
So after move badgering me I moved my hands. And he was like damn they are perfect and even took pictures. 
So as the night progressed we were just chillin and drinking. And it led to the girl and I making out for fun. And then I had sex with the guy and the girl gave him a blow job. Mind you that I would have NEVER had sex with this guy if I was sober. 
After it was all over I started to sober up and I felt sick. I was so consumed with guilt. I had a few month before broken up with my boyfriend that I still wanted to be with. And just had sex with the guy he hates most in this world. And after it all they both said, what happened here tonight isn’t allowed to leave this room. Even, Eric (named changed to protect identity). Eric and I had a long history and were best friends. So I told him what happened the next night because I wasn’t able to keep it from him, and I saw him cry for the first time in my life. And that was soul crushing to me. Because I hurt someone I loved so much. 
I haven’t talked to the guy I slept with since a few nights after this happened. I used to be super close with him. 
I still feel very guilty about the situation. And writing about it now I had a pit in my stomach. If I ever saw this guy again I’d probably have a panic attack. 
So Eric is actually now my husband. And we were talking about this the other night and he said I think that he raped you.
I guess my question is, is that considered rape?
Part of me thinks it might be, because if I was sober there’s no way that I would do that. I didn’t want to in the first place, but was talked into it. But the other part of me wonders if I want to believe it’s that so I stop feeling so guilty for what happened. But I also don’t know that I believe that he wanted to hurt me. 
But my husband thinks that he took advantage of me. 
What do you think?

Also bless you if you read this far. ",AskWomen,"I have a big question...I want to start this off by saying I obviously need to see a therapist, and I plan on it, I just haven’t been yet. 

So let’s start off with the story. One night, 4ish years ago, I went to a guy’s house that I had been pretty close with for many years, with one of my girl friends. We decided to pick up some beers at Walmart and just hung out at his apartment. We were talking and somehow my boobs got brought up. And my girl friend was saying that I would show my guy friend my boobs, because they were perfect, and he was always curious. And I was sn’t very fond of the idea, but I was also proud of my boobs. So I took my shirt off. And my girl friend was like no your bra too! I was a pretty conservative person. Only had kissed and had sex with one guy at this point in my life. So i said no and they were like it’s fine! They look great just do it! So I did. But  put my hands over them. And I looked over and saw a big canvas of the guy we were with and his fiancé. (I know this is all very wrong) and I was like uhhhh... so he went over and laid the canvas down so we couldn’t see it anymore. 
So after move badgering me I moved my hands. And he was like damn they are perfect and even took pictures. 
So as the night progressed we were just chillin and drinking. And it led to the girl and I making out for fun. And then I had sex with the guy and the girl gave him a blow job. Mind you that I would have NEVER had sex with this guy if I was sober. 
After it was all over I started to sober up and I felt sick. I was so consumed with guilt. I had a few month before broken up with my boyfriend that I still wanted to be with. And just had sex with the guy he hates most in this world. And after it all they both said, what happened here tonight isn’t allowed to leave this room. Even, Eric (named changed to protect identity). Eric and I had a long history and were best friends. So I told him what happened the next night because I wasn’t able to keep it from him, and I saw him cry for the first time in my life. And that was soul crushing to me. Because I hurt someone I loved so much. 
I haven’t talked to the guy I slept with since a few nights after this happened. I used to be super close with him. 
I still feel very guilty about the situation. And writing about it now I had a pit in my stomach. If I ever saw this guy again I’d probably have a panic attack. 
So Eric is actually now my husband. And we were talking about this the other night and he said I think that he raped you.
I guess my question is, is that considered rape?
Part of me thinks it might be, because if I was sober there’s no way that I would do that. I didn’t want to in the first place, but was talked into it.

"Broke up with long time best friend, how do you let go?","This seemed like as good a place as any to ask this. I just want to see if anyone has been in a similar situation and what you did, cause I'm a bit lost. 
 TL;DR- found at the bottom. The story's a little... Complicated. 

Today is my best friend's birthday, and this is the first time in 14 years I haven't  wished him Happy Birthday.  Cause I broke up with him... Sort of. 

We met by accident. I was reading at a coffee shop downtown after an appointment, he thought I was his blind date that didn't show up. We started talking, and basically never stopped.  We hung out several times a week, talking every day for hours. This became our normal. Even when he had a girlfriend, the amount of time we spent together didn't really change.  2.5 years after our first meeting,  he was single at the time, I told him I had ""feelings"" for him, we talked about it for a while, he told me why it would never work etc. It sucked, but what could I do? I started to back off a bit, but over time he'd call to talk, and want to hang out, we eventually went back to how things were before I'd made it awkward.  ( We would have the conversation a few more times over the years, mostly to explain why I didn't want to keep in touch, but nothing  changed.) 
2 years after that I decided to live abroad for a while, I felt strongly it was something I needed to do. I worked up the courage  to tell him two months before I left. He was, not mad, but just 100% against my going. He kept trying to convince me to stay, talking about why I didn't need to go... I did leave, it was an amazing experience, and to his credit, he wrote me a few times while I was gone. Actual pen and paper letters. They were sweet, and though he still didn't understand my choice, they were encouraging. 
When I moved back, we immediately picked up where we left off,(  he now had a girlfriend who lived in a different city, I didn't know this at the time, probably a red flag, right?!) and it was great. 

I should note,  Something else I should have seen as a red flag. All this time we were hanging out, I introduced him to my friends and some of my siblings, but I never met any of his friends, ever. I don't know why that didn't seem weird to me. 

Anyways... This is how it went for a few more years, I dated a few guys here and there, but it's hard when you're in love with someone else, who you connect with on a level that no other human being has, and you also spend a lot of time with, but doesn't love you back, or want let you go.  Like, the majority of the time, he'd instigate the hang outs or message me first, especially when I'd get sick of it and try to stop talking to him for a few days. 

Eventually, I found out about his girlfriend, when he told me he wanted to propose to her, and wanted to know if I thought that was a good idea. I figured message, loud and clear,   I just wanted him to be happy, even if it wasn't with me. I, in turn packed up and moved across the country. Time to start a fresh. 

3 months later however, I got a text from him asking if I could help he and his g/f find a place in the city I had moved to. I shouldn't have but I did, at least I could make sure they weren't too close to me.  I was casually seeing a guy from School, my friend didn't like him much, and didn't want to hang out as couples.  I eventually moved back to our hometown, he moved to the opposite side of the country after breaking up with his girlfriend.

I tried cutting it off with him a few times over the next few years. But I still loved/ love him. Nothing would make my day like a silly text from him. There were whole months where I wouldn't talk to him, but then he'd message me, and we'd start talking again, and I'd feel happy again, but not at the same time.
New Years Eve this year, I made a resolution. It was over, 100%. I blocked him on Facebook, changed my email. Blocked him from my phone. Haven't spoken to him since. This is the first time in 14 years where we haven't wished each other happy birthday, and I miss him. 


I guess the TL;DR is, wasted a craps tonne of time on someone who never loved me, but no one could compare to.  Time go get over it and let go.. 
But how???

How would you feel if your SO did this? Details inside :(,"Hello,

Basically, my SO and I are both in our early twenties and we sometimes hang out with a group of friends (from secondary school) every now and then. One of those days, we were playing ""Honesty"" where a question is asked and you have to answer honestly as the name suggests. 

The question my boyfriend got was to rate his past and current SOs which includes me and his ex who is in the group of friends we hang out with. 

He rates me a 7 out of 10 and when it gets to her, an 8. 

I obviously was upset, but was trying hard not to show anything because I was embarrased that he said this in front of others, especially the ex. 

I was just wondering if this is something that I should get over because I know I don't have to be perfect or even prettier than his past girlfriends, but I can't help but feel pretty stepped on because it is obvious I am not as beautiful in his eyes.

The worst part is that I was in the room and he even *looked* at me and hesitated before he said it. He knew it was wrong to say that, especially in front of his *daughter* but he said it anyway.

How much of an age gap is too much? Do you have any advice for a hopeless 18m?,"Hello.  I am 18M and have fallen HARD for my best friend 23F. I feel like I'm spamming Reddit with my posts but I still feel very insecure and like I need a bit more advice. I hope this is allowed and okay to post!

So I've been friends with her for a few months now and we met because we both play the same online game together. We get along so well and are very similar in our hobbies and interests. We call a lot and my friends and I love playing with her. I've just started my apprenticeship as a mechanic and she works as a receptionist and we've both skipped university. 

Essentially the biggest worry for me is the age gap. I feel a bit better now as people on the relationships subreddit have calmed me a little but I'm still in need of more advice. I really like this girl and her friendship means so much to me. We have very good ""banter"" and can be quite flirty together but I feel like I always held back because I thought it was too much of an age gap and was wrong, but now I feel like just jumping in to the deep end and giving it all I've got.

She's so beautiful and kind and helpful I don't want to lose her as a friend because she genuinely has been such a good friend to me. I'm scared if I tell her how I feel she'll run a mile from me so I'm planning on just being her friend for now and see where the flirting takes us I guess. I really like her and want to be with her but for now I don't want to take that risk.

Do you have any advice for me? Should I just go for it or is the age gap a little too much? Thank you in advance!!",AskWomen,"How much of an age gap is too much?

Boyfriend is too close with (girl)friends,"   I've had different times where I had to be the jealous girlfriend (and I really, really  hate it because its not who I am at all) because my boyfriend prefers to be friends with girls instead of guys. He's faithful and loyal, that is not whats in question here, it's just he's a very passionate person and very intense and he's also very comprehensive and compassionate, so some friends of his end up falling for him (has happened 3 times since we started dating, one girl even end up kissing him when he was trying to comfort her because she was feeling upset) and I really feel like sometimes it's his fault because he doesn't know how to set some boundaries right in the beginning, he just looks too available.  

  I have several friends at university who are guys and I always make sure there is some distance so there's no misunderstanding. Not saying blatantly 'I have a boyfriend' but just the way I act and behave with them. And I don't think my boyfriend has that same concern with his friends. He doesn't like hanging out in groups, so he just meets that one friend for a coffee or lunch break, and I feel  they completely get the wrong message. He told me he gets really frustrated with it, he says he can't have longterm friends because that always happens but at the same time he doesn't want to stop being himself because of this. I told him he should have some boundaries and be more careful with things he says but he feels that Im just too biased to have an impartial view of things and that my behavior is cold towards my friends and that sometimes I have no empathy for others, and also since it's other girls interested in my boyfriend I'm saying these things out of jealousy. I don't know what else to say to show him that he should change his behavior with other girls because it always ends up hurting him and me (and that other girl) 

Would really like some help on how to deal with this.

Motion sickness &amp; nausea from wearing turtlenecks or chokers (something that touch but not restrict your neck)?,"Hi ladies!

I've been trying to Google this but I never ever get any answers. I figured I could try asking here since AskReddit is only for thought provoking stuff.

I'm a 21F, I used to get motion sick on car/boat rides very easily as a kid. I still get them now but not as bad (I won't puke, even though I might feel like wanting to)

I noticed that whenever I wear turtle necks, scarves, chokers, my body gets a mild gag reflex thing going on which leads to me feeling motion sick and nauseous even if I'm just sitting in a room and not actually moving. And it's not like they are so tight that they're restricting me or anything, they're just, there.

And every time this ^ happens, all I have to do is pull the neckline of the top a little further away from my neck and I instantly feel a little better. Or like, remove my scarf/necklace.

Can someone explain this phenomenon to me? Does anyone here experience something similar....?

Has your sexual attraction towards a person ever grown with time from a neutral starting point?,"Hello, I need some information. A while ago I dated this girl. At the beginning I wasn't really sexually attracted to her but I gave her a second chance, then I got strongly into her and I was reciprocated bu then she had to leave for a while and when we met again I changed my mind again. She went through the same rollercoaster as me and while I was willing to try again, she wasn't, so the relationship ended.

I know why I wasn't totally attracted to her: I didn't like a thing about her body that I considered barely tolerable. This was the first time ever that I changed my opinion in a short amount of time without seeing major changes. So I know how it works at least for me, a man.

I'm interested to know how it works for you women.

I've always believed that an initial rejection was 99.999% final and I guess you are going to confirm this but I'm interested in a more general case where you are neutral about a guy and start to feel really attracted to him without many look changes on his side and if this effect lasted for a little while or a long time.

I’m [F20] not sure if I’ve ever had a g spot orgasm. What does it feel like compared to a clitoral orgasm? [nsfw],"I’m not sure if I’ve ever had an orgasm from being penetrated... ever. I’ve always masturbated by clitoral stimulation and have always came that way without fail. 
It makes me kinda sad and makes me feel lesser / “broken” that so many women, including the likes of my boyfriends past partners (apparently lol), can orgasm via penetration but I just can’t seem to. At least, I don’t think I can. I know everyone’s different, and I do sometimes get intense build up of what I can only describe as a pressure inside to the point where it almost aches/hurts(??? In a.... nice way? I guess???) and I recall a few times it being so overwhelming that I started to cry uncontrollably. Other times when it happens I feel like I can’t think straight and I’m not sure why it happens. I’ve always put it down to being anxiety related and related to past uh traumas if you wish... I try to relax and let myself go and I am very comfortable with my boyfriend so I don’t think it’s just a mental block. 

So women of Reddit, what are the differences between orgasming via clit vs orgasming via g spot / penetration?

Ovarian Cyst Laparoscopy,"So, kinda long, sorry. I have been dealing with abdominal pain and swelling along with intense back pain for about a month now. I’ve spent most nights lying on a heating pad and unable to button or zip any of the pants I own because of the swelling. Finally, the pain was bad enough that I couldn’t sleep or get comfortable. I went to the ER. They did urine test, blood work, and a CT scan with contrast and found an ovarian cyst that was 3.3 cm (1.29 inches) in size. They basically just said the cyst was irritating my body and then, cyclically, the irritation was causing pain - which was causing more irritation. They gave me 800 mg ibuprofen to help with the swelling and pain and sent me on my way.

A week later, and things hadn’t improved. I was still in intense pain, still swollen. My chiropractor strongly encouraged me to see my gyno ASAP. I got a lunchtime appointment on a Wednesday. I saw him and brought a copy of the report. He read the report, examined me internally and externally, and determined that I needed emergency surgery on Friday. Surgery proceeded and seemed to go well. 

At my follow-up yesterday (5 days after surgery), he said that when he did the surgery, he didn’t find any endometriosis, scarring, or other abnormalities. He just found “a very large cyst”. I asked how large it was and he made a circle gesture with his thumb and forefinger roughly the size of two golf balls put together! 😱 Then he said they pulled it out through the incision in my belly button. (HOW?! 😳) I guess that means it must’ve been growing in size fairly rapidly because it was only 3.3 cm (1.29 inches) when I went to the ER for pain only a week before the surgery. 

He pulled off all my surgical glue and told me that 2 out of 3 incisions were already closed. The last one hadn’t quite closed. He put some surgical tape over it to help give it support. He told me to leave it on for 2-3 days. 

He said to refrain from heavy lifting or going to the gym for another 2 ish weeks but that I was fine to do normal house hold stuff. I’d been doing 1/2 work days in the actual office with the other 1/2 of the work day being spent working from home where I could accommodate my needs to lie down, sit down, or work standing up more easily. 

In other words, things seemed to be going well! I had been feeling better and hadn’t taken any Advil since about 10 am that morning. By about 8:45 pm, I had to take some Advil. Underneath the area where the doctor had pulled off the glue from the not-quite-sealed incision, the swelling and pain were worse, and it almost felt like little muscle twitches were occurring. 

This morning, right before heading to a work meeting, I noticed that I had a red rash and what I would describe as little blisters (like when a sunburn is peeling) where the ends of the little pieces of medical tape were touching my skin. I was having some kind of allergic reaction to the tape on my skin. Not being sure if the increased swelling/pain were related to this new symptom, I called the doctor’s office. I spoke with the doctor, who asked me to describe the issue. Then, he prescribed me an oral antibiotic (in case something was also going on internally) and a topical cream to rub on the irritated skin. He told me if I wasn’t feeling better by tomorrow  (Friday) night, I was supposed to call him. 

I’ve noticed that the area around my left hip crease has been very tender and still looks swollen too. I’m not sure if that’s normal or not. Overall, I’m feeling sore, swollen, tired, and I just want to get better! Do any of you have experience with laparoscopy or ovarian cyst issues that you’d mind sharing? I’m feeling particularly frustrated because my best friend’s wedding is Saturday - and I’m in it! I feel like total crap and to make matters worse, my doctor is leaving on Sunday for two weeks. 😭 Thanks in advance for your help! ",AskWomen,"Ovarian Cyst LaparoscopySo, kinda long, sorry.

Is it petty to not date a girl based off of her history? w/ me [19 M] and her [19 F].,"**tldr: I'm nervous about pursuing a relationship with a girl who has a bad track record in relationships.**

I met this girl at this new college I'm going to and she's awesome! We are best friends and have been for a month now. We immediately became best friends and we are always hanging out together. I have played with the idea of asking her out but what stops me is how she seems to handle relationships. I have only had 1 girlfriend before and we lasted almost 2 years before the distance just got to be too much for us. This new girl though hasn't been in a relationship for longer than half a year. But, the thing is, she is always with new guys. I don't know how many guys she has actually been with but she has told me that she doesn't count guys in her body count if she doesn't climax (that number was 4 btw) and she has said that she has had 2 miscarriages in her life already. She is always bringing up sexual stories that she finds funny and it feels to me like each story is always with a new guy. I feel bad for even saying it, but as a guy with a body count of 1 this seems like almost TOO much.

We love being around each other and people keep telling us that the other person likes the other (which is true. We talked about it and we both are kinda crushing on each other). But, what really stops me is how she is literally always talking to new guys. I've known her for a month now as her best friend and I have already seen 2 relationships end and tons of guys get shot down. She jumps from guy to guy that she meets on Tinder and is always talking to new guys everyday. Like, she only has one female friend and even she says that there are TOO many guys in her life. I can't stand the idea of just becoming a number to this girl because i really like her.

If I knew that she would stop flirting with her 30+ daily matches on Tinder, and had less of a past I would be pursuing a relationship with this girl because she makes me happier than anything else right now.

I'm in need of some advice...,"Tried to ask on r/Tinder but the site spam filter picked it up for some reason. This past spring I started to get big into Tinder, basically I had come out of a relationship in fall, the year prior (2017) and was looking to start anew. Now, I wouldn’t consider myself a “looker” but I’ve never thought I’m real ugly or particularly bad looking. Throughout the entire time I had the app (about 5 months starting in Feb 2018), I hardly ever received matches. Maybe 1 or 2 a month of I was lucky. I live in a pretty suburban/urban outskirts area too, and I was so desperate for the validation of receiving a match that I would swipe for like an hour and a half straight and simply run out of people. Like the app just went Kaputt and I was fresh out. But one day I saw a girl who was just beautiful to me.

This past spring I started to get big into Tinder, basically I had come out of a relationship in fall, the year prior (2017) and was looking to start anew. Now, I wouldn’t consider myself a “looker” but I’ve never thought I’m real ugly or particularly bad looking.

How to meet someone while travelling?,"Its interesting where you end up after a few clicks. After reading a posting here about meeting that special someone online, I decided to post my own inquiry.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a guy, and my job involves a lot of travel, at least 50% of the time currently. I love travel, especially internationally. But also because I don't have anyone at home (except for a cat, and well, he's a cat). Typically I'm in once place for a week or two doing my job and then fly home. And I do enjoy my job (its a geeky computer sort of job)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what's the best way to try and meet someone while travelling? Here on reddit or otherwise (online or in person). I'm not the super outgoing guy who chats up women at a bar. And I've created a post or two here (and dating sites) that haven't really garnered much attention. And to say my social circle is small is to put it mildly.  I can honestly say I'd like to meet someone and have an actual relationship though. I'm 100% single (again, except for the aformentioned feline)

I'm in my 40's, own my own place and I'm doing pretty well in my life. Except finding that special someone.

**What We Are Looking For**

* Engagement:  We discuss a lot of mod related issues using Discord, so participating in that is a requirement.  You don't need to have notifications on for the mod chat(s), but we need to be able to contact you outside of Reddit if need be.  Beyond that, you are expected to be able to moderate the community in a notable way.  We don't require a specific minimum of moderating from you each day or anything like that, but we're recruiting because there's work to be done, not just goofy unapproved threads to laugh at.

This means understanding not just the letter of the rules, but the spirit of them as well.  Being a mod does not mean you live your life by our rules or anything that, but when it comes to the community we work to facilitate a conversational forum that is designed with a Q&amp;A format best suited to support a varying and dissimilar community, so it's important that you understand not just what our rules are, but what their benefits are.

Can you commit time to do the small mundane work removing rulebreaking material, responding to mod mail, assisting and providing a second voice on other cases, discussing how rules are enforced, and sometimes writing policy/time sensitive items, all in a constructive manner?  Can you be around at odd hours or write CSS? Do you have experience and a desire to improve the community?

How to present a special (and expensive) gift to my S.O. - she loves surprises; I hate them.,"To celebrate a few personal milestones, and also because my better half deserves nothing less than the best in this world, I had a close friend of my SO find out that my SO would really like a certain piece of jewelry. It will cost several thousand dollars, and I’d absolutely love to buy it for her. I’m certain this friend’s information is reliable, because I recall my SO referencing this jewelry item in the past. Her friend’s independent verification (without goading her in any particular direction) merely confirmed my old and forgotten recollection.

As someone who hates surprises, I cannot get myself to risk spending thousands on a piece of jewelry, with any risk of “getting it wrong”. So, I purchased a costume version of that jewelry item, and intend to present it as a surprise at some point, and then inform her that this item is costume, and I intend to buy her a real one after she chooses one from a jeweler.

My SO knows me well (we’ve been in a relationship for over a decade), and finding out I chose costume jewelry as a temporary hold-over to avoid a mistake will not surprise her; she knows it’s difficult for me to stomach surprises.

That said, I’m wondering if any of the ladies on this chat could offer some guidance on how to follow through on this surprise gift presentation? Specifically, how quickly should I tell her this ring is costume? Should I give her a minute or two to be shocked, or tell her he second she opens the box?

How to talk to people ?,"My situation: I m over twenty five year old  and I m studying in a high school. It s my second year with the same  class and I want to know them more. But I m very shy there.( I m shy in  general. ) I m talking with my only friend in my class but she want to  talk more also with our other comrade. If we are together with the same  people, we are very quiet and we listen to the group. Now she is  becoming less shy.

First, I wasn't quick  enough to say something in time if I wanted to intervene with the other  comrade. Now I m capable to express my toughs in time and I have the  bravery to do so but I don't know what to say to them. It bother me a  great deal because it make me feel uncomfortable sometime and sometimes I  m thinking that the other are not staying with me because I m silent  often.

It s really bother me. I m afraid I  would stay alone in school. I don't want that at all! I also don't  understand the reference of the jokes or the movies, or series, or memes  that they are talking about (and I could not remember them yet after so  I would look at them at home.) I m afraid to ask them about it because I  m afraid they would think bad of me for not knowing. We aren't from the  same background. I told to some about my background or my life. But it s  in passing. We talked.

I  don't know if I need to give up about socialization with other or just  with the same class. I don't know if I should talk to them about that; I  talked to some and they helped me a bit but the couldn't or shouldn't  do more? I don't know if I should give up and go and meet other people  in the school. ( I don't know how to do but I could think about it.)

I  want to be friend with someone with who I go along. I have people I m  close to but I don't have friends yet that I m close to. I kind of went  trough a lot of trouble and kind of lost the touch with the people I was  close to.

But I m very shy there.( I m shy in  general. ) I m talking with my only friend in my class but she want to  talk more also with our other comrade. If we are together with the same  people, we are very quiet and we listen to the group. Now she is  becoming less shy.

First, I wasn't quick  enough to say something in time if I wanted to intervene with the other  comrade. Now I m capable to express my toughs in time and I have the  bravery to do so but I don't know what to say to them. It bother me a  great deal because it make me feel uncomfortable sometime and sometimes I  m thinking that the other are not staying with me because I m silent  often.

It s really bother me. I m afraid I  would stay alone in school. I don't want that at all! I also don't  understand the reference of the jokes or the movies, or series, or memes  that they are talking about (and I could not remember them yet after so  I would look at them at home.) I m afraid to ask them about it because I  m afraid they would think bad of me for not knowing. We aren't from the  same background. I told to some about my background or my life. But it s  in passing. We talked.

I  don't know if I need to give up about socialization with other or just  with the same class. I don't know if I should talk to them about that; I  talked to some and they helped me a bit but the couldn't or shouldn't  do more? I don't know if I should give up and go and meet other people  in the school. ( I don't know how to do but I could think about it.)

I  want to be friend with someone with who I go along. I have people I m  close to but I don't have friends yet that I m close to. I kind of went  trough a lot of trouble and kind of lost the touch with the people I was  close to.

Thank to you all for reading this;

Have a nice day !"

"What are your true love stories where you did *not* “just know” right away, but it still worked out?","I feel like I keep seeing stories where someone just knew they would end up marrying someone the first time they ever met.  

These stories are wonderful, but also a bit disheartening for me.   My parents had a very traumatizing and ugly divorce that stayed ugly for 18+ years and counting.   It doesn’t matter if my SO is a saint, I just have trust issues until it’s slowly built over time.   

I did have that knowing feeling once or twice but it amounted to nothing and was just a crush.    Plus I have had friends say they were gonna marry their SO from day 1, only for it to end quickly. 

Now I did see that it just might work out when I met my SO, but I didn’t have that magical “just knowing” and I think that’s just my nature.


That is why I would love to hear stories of the other side of love, where you took a lot of time to consider and connect.   Both sides are beautiful but I would like some positive stories.

{Not Dating} Friend's Date Fell Asleep...,"So a friend of mine (legit, not a cover) was on a date with a newish (4 dates in 2 months with sporadic texting, with her being the one to start most of it) guy at her house. They had planned pizza and margaritas and maybe a little hot tubbing. He works not too far from her house and asked if he could pack a bag ""in case the drinks got to him"". She said it was okay.

She orders the pizza, they eat it and then they start a movie. He falls asleep during the movie and after it finishes she wakes him up and says tells him that he feel asleep. He tells her that he wants to sleep and just sleeps there on her couch for the next few hours,  while she sit in not sleeping in her room.

Around 1am she hears him shuffling around, and she goes to investigate. He then remembers that they had planned on hot tubbing and asks if they can go, knowing she is starting the first day of her internship in the morning.

She agrees for some reason, and after that just goes back to sleep on her couch until the next morning when he has to leave for work.

During this date they barely cuddled, there was no kissing or anything further. 

Is it just me or does it seem like he just used her house as hotel for the night?

I am uncomfortable with the fact that she thinks it is ""safe"" to let him stay at her house given how little she knows about him, and though their  other dates sounded pretty normal, if a little unevenly spaced. But something about this story doesn't sit right with me. Is it just me? Or does this seem odd to you as well?

My Addiction: Hair Extensions,"Am I the only one that has a huge reliance on weave and hair extensions? Anyone?! I know it’s not just me… Right?! I love Mink Brazilin Body Wave hair and Malaysian Curly hair just as much as the next girl, but sometimes I think I am a little too dependent on other people’s hair. 
For the past 10 years or so I have relied on hair extensions, weaves and wigs to have the appearance of shinier, healthier and fuller looking hair. For me it’s more about convenience more than anything. I hate having to deal with my natural hair. It’s just so much easier to straighten, curl, bleach or dye hair extension versus damaging my very own hair. For me, all kinds of types of hair extensions have been a life saver for me. You name it, I’ve probably had it. From cornrow, box braids, clips ins or even a full head sew-in. I love them all! 
A few months ago, I called myself giving my hair a break from all hair extensions and weaves. I said to myself “you need to let your hair breathe” and “embrace your natural beauty”. I’ve been off of the “weave crack” for the last 6 months and I must admit I am feening to get my hands on some long flowy luscious virgin hair bundles to have installed in my head. 
I called myself swearing off fake hair for at least for 1 year. However, I am struggling to keep this promise. I miss my virgin hair and how easy it is to maintain. However, after only six months in I want to sew in some tracks worse than ever. I’ve had to ask myself, why I feel so strongly about wearing weave and I can simply shrug it off for the convenience. But could it be more complex than that? 
Do I not feel as beautiful rocking my natural hair? Do I feel less confident without the 20 inches of Brazilian Body Wave flowing down my back? 
The truth is, weaves and wigs had become like a security blanket for me and I’m sure for other women as well (as much as they do not want to admit it). I had become addicted to the fantasy and accessibility of it all. Don’t get me wrong, I love hair extensions and don’t thing I will ever just do away with them for good but I have committed myself to being more and  feeling more comfortable in my own beauty. That includes my hair and skin. I guess you can say I’m pulling an Alicia Keys moments, but I think it’s important for woman to feel gorgeous on the inside just as much as on the outside with the assets only God has given them. I am growing and learning to do this. So that way I can have the best of both worlds no matter if I’m wearing my hair or virgin hair bundles shout out to my number one supplier dynastygoddess.com

How do I ask if someone I am interested in is dating a friend?,"23 male in college, Computer science major. I found a girl via a shared class who is of the same major. She is attractive, smart, confident and bold, we also share interests however:
1)  I am concerned she may be dating a friend I met in the same class. I know him better than her.
2)  she is 3 years younger but mature. However I feel conflicted because part of me say she is too young. It's the age, not the age gap.

I was planning to ask her to a cup of coffee of match of ping pong sometime.

Are romantic comedies not a good thing?,"Okay, so lately there has seemed to be a resurgence (to me at least) of romantic comedies coming out. I'm just wondering what other people think about romantic comedies. 

My thoughts are:

Yes they can be fun. But, does it set bad expectations for people's relationships? Are they more fantasy than reality? If we use rom coms as escapism does that mean the relationships we do have are 'boring'? 

I know some people just use it as entertainment, but I just wonder about the ramifications for relationships in general. I guess I'm just not sure how I should feel about rom coms these days. Because love can be portrayed in this fantastical way on screen but I feel like in real life it is much grittier than that??? I dunno if I need to edit to expand more, but I figured I stop here before I keep rambling.

"If someone were to make a ""first time"" kit for women, what would you want in your kit?","Hi there -

A  year ago, I came across this [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/5aibew/condom_companies_should_have_a_first_time_kit/) that said it would be great if a company made a first time kit for sex and included things like different types of condom, some lubricant, and tips. This struck a cord with me, and it's something I've been trying to get off the ground for a while. 

I'm pretty close, but as I re-read the comments in the original post, I realized that the perspective in the comments were mostly of men. I spoke with my wife and some female friends, and they said that it was disappointing that the original Reddit post came from a place where a ""first time kit"" would be a male-facing product because the man is supposed to bring the condom. But, in their experience, they prefer to have a back up condom as well just in case the man didn't come prepared and having a service that provided different condoms for the woman to try in the privacy of her own room would be great so she can figure out what style and fit worked for her. But, I'd like to get more stories and perspectives on this. 

So, if I may be so bold, I'd like to know what the community or /r/AskWomen thinks about a first time kit. How would you want the kit delivered? Would a simple, discrete brown box suffice? What would you like in the box? Is there anything that current sexual wellness companies are missing for you?",AskWomen,"If someone were to make a ""first time"" kit for women, what would you want in your kit?Hi there -

I've never been romantically pursued by anyone...,"I'm 25...and throughout my twenties, I've never been actively pursued or asked on a date by anyone...minus when I worked in a bar and older, creepy men would try to flirt with me or give me half-melted chocolates as a ""present."" Men/women look at me from afar, or compliment me but I am never approached. I think the only time I can remember a guy having a crush on me and coming up to ask me out was when I was 11 years old, haha

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I am unattractive, and I've been in a LTR before (4 years)...but I feel like either: 

a) I give off some kind of unapproachable vibe 

b) Most British men (at least in my line of work) do not know how to approach black women or want to 

c) I have perhaps been brainwashed by an unrealistic idea we're presented in media...that men will always chase after the woman they want

d) I'm less attractive than I thought

&amp;#x200B;

All of of my romances have been hetero so far, but I am bisexual:  All of the men that I have been involved with romantically/sexually, I have had to initiate communication or let them know that I am interested before they saw me as someone they might want to date/sleep with. I don't have a problem with letting a guy know I'm into them, but it'd be nice to understand why I've always had to make the first move or feel like I don't have to do all of the work.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR // 

Has anyone else constantly had to be the initiator in their romantic relationships and has that affected how you feel about yourself or do you view it negatively? 

In heterosexual dating - do you think that the idea that ""men should always approach first"" is detrimental to women looking to find partners/sex?

Does anyone else experience significant hormonal imbalances cycle to cycle?,"Hi ladies, 

I went off the pill about 6 months ago as my partner and I are trying for a baby. I was on the pill for about 15 years and my libido was fairly ‘normal’ I think (whatever normal is). By that I mean it was the same throughout my cycle, and we would have sex a couple of times a week. 

Since being off the pill, just before and during ovulation my libido skyrockets significantly, for about week, and then the other 3 weeks it’s normal again, maybe a little higher than before. 

I know that this is fairly common during and prior to ovulation, but it’s just such a swift change, at exactly the same time each month, for exactly the same amount of time. I also get breakouts on my face so I am quite sure it is hormonal rather than some sort of mood disorder. 

I do love being in the mood all the time during that week, and we are trying for a baby, but sometimes I have difficulty concentrating on work tasks etc. because I am thinking about sex all the time. I am noticing other guys a lot, where as I never did before (I don’t feel the urge to cheat - I just notice hot guys everywhere). And for some strange reason, and this is very random, I am intensely attracted to younger guys, like in a cougarish way (weird I know, but I’d love to know if anybody else experiences this).

My question is, do any other women experience such a drastic fluctuation and how do they deal with it? Is there a way to even out my hormones so they are a bit more stable? I don’t want to get rid of my higher libido because it’s lots of fun, but if it was a bit lower and consistent throughout the month life that would be nice. I’m 35 by the way.

I know this is probably something I can’t control but thought I’d at least ask... 

Thanks x

I (18F) am in love with my boyfriend's (21M) friend (20M) and I don't know what to do.,"Although our relationship isn't perfect, I do love my boyfriend very much. I can't imagine breaking it off with him because I know it would absolutely break his heart. We have been together for almost 1.5 years and he lives in my house. We get along for the most part, but our future plans don't align very well (I want kids, he doesn't; I want to move somewhere away from our area, he wants to stay here forever, etc.).

​

Anyway that's enough background, I'll move on to the important part. When I first met his friend (let's call the friend Jacob and my boyfriend Peter), I felt a connection that felt completely different to when I first met Peter. We 'clicked' immediately and have been good friends ever since. I feel as though Jacob is much more my type - he's a party animal, has a manual labour job, funny, tough, and just a real 'manly man'. Meanwhile Peter has an office job, falls asleep by 8:30pm almost every night, doesn't really like to go out as much, etc. (but he's funny as well, I'll admit). Anyway, there's really no way to explain why I feel so attracted to Jacob, there has just always been something between us.

​

It's no surprise that a couple of people have picked up on my feelings - when I told my Mum and best friend that I had started having feelings for someone other than Peter, they immediately guessed Jacob. They both said it was the way I talked about him - they could just tell that I really cared about him. As he's a big drinker, there have been a few times where he's ended up stranded at our local pub and has called my boyfriend to pick him up. As Peter is usually heavily asleep by that time (2-3am), I will pick him up. When we're out together as a group, he's been known to collapse in gutters or sleep in his car, so I sit with him and convince him to come back to my house so he has a bed to sleep in. But it's not just *me* that looks out for *him.* One time we went out as a group to an unfamiliar bar in the city, and sleazy guys were all over me like flies. Usually I'd just say I have a boyfriend and walk away and they'd leave me alone, but one guy just kept coming to our table even though I'd told him I had a boyfriend and he'd even spoken to Peter. So I'm sitting in the middle of a booth directly across from Jacob when I see this guy turn up again. He stood on the booth next to me and the next thing I knew he'd lifted one leg over me as though he was trying to get into the seat next to me, but then started grinding his groin on the back of my head. Jacob saw my eyes go wide and that I was trying to duck away from him, and just went off at him. He said to the guy 'Get the fuck off her and never touch her again. That's his (pointing to Peter) missus, get the fuck off her.' So the guy quickly got off me and sat beside me, obviously petrified of Jacob. He reached out to Peter (who was sitting next to Jacob and hadn't seen anything because he was talking to someone next to him) and said 'I'm so sorry man, I didn't realise that was your girlfriend. You're a lucky bloke though I'll tell you,' and all this shit. But Peter just laughed and said not to worry about it, it was all good. He hadn't even seen what the guy had done, he could've done anything for Christ's sake! Meanwhile, Jacob was fuming and wanted this guy right away from us, so he went to security and told them that he wouldn't stop touching me and he needed to get out. I overheard him, and he literally said 'she's my main concern and he won't leave her alone, just get him out.' Talk about how to make a girl swoon! Meanwhile, Peter was none the wiser of what was going on. From then on, any guy who came up to me, even just to offer to buy me a drink, Jacob went and told security and they got kicked out. He made me feel so safe, while Peter wasn't even paying attention and even when I told him what was going on, he really didn't care. It's happened many times at our local pub too. That doesn't seem like something just a 'friend' would do, or am I reading into it?

​

Anyway, I know how wrong this is and I feel like the shittiest person alive, but I can't control myself when I'm around Jacob. I haven't done anything obvious, but I always want to be around him. He's known as the DJ in our group, and he's always asking me what songs I want on because we have the exact same taste in music. My boyfriend never dances, so sometimes I end up on the dance floor with Jacob. Whenever I can, I choose to sit next to or near him. I had a party at my house the other night and in the end it was just me and him left, everyone else had gone home or was asleep. We stayed up for a while just dancing and being stupid together. We fell asleep on the lounge together (not really together, I was on one end and he was on the other) for the second time. That night was the most intense it had ever been. It was so hard to stop myself from telling him how I felt.

​

I'm being ridiculously selfish because I don't want to leave the comfort of my secure (yet not completely happy) relationship with Peter, but I know if I don't do something and Jacob eventually gets a girlfriend, I would be absolutely shattered. It isn't just a crush, I genuinely care about his wellbeing as much as I care about my boyfriend's.

​

It's just a case of loving someone who you could never be with though. Even if I did break up with Peter, isn't Jacob still off limits? Surely they couldn't be friends if Jacob was with Peter's ex? Of course I wouldn't jump from one relationship to another, I'd give it a few months before reaching out to Jacob and see if the feelings I have for him are mutual, or if I've just completely fucked myself over. I have been agonising over this for months now and I feel as though it is *definitely* not fair to my boyfriend, who as far as I know has no idea anything is going on. I feel absolutely terrible about the situation, but I can't just turn my feelings for Jacob off, I really think I love him.

I’ve been thinking about getting an actual wax since the hair closer to my bottom is hard to reach with the electric razor. I also have been a little self conscious in shorts since they are short shorts and I have to be careful to keep everything covered. Sometimes I get folliculitis but do have a tropical cream from my doctor.

Sooo, should I make an appointment for Tuesday right before I leave to go to grad school?

Looking for pillow recommendations,"As the title states, I'm looking for a bit of advice on pillows. I consistently sleep on my back and my sides, and I've been struggling to find a pillow type that suits both and allows me to wake up pain free. I've tried firm, medium firm, down cool, and down alternative pillows. My favorites were the latter two types, but with the down cool pillow I typically wake up with neck pain, and the down alternative doesn't provide much support on my sides (also goes flat quickly).

FAQ Q&amp;A: What is your unpopular opinion?,"Hello, AskWomen!

If you want to have an in-depth conversation about someone's answer, take it to PMs.

Today's question is: **What is your unpopular opinion?**

A special note on this topic.  This is a question we have submitted *incredibly* frequently, and it is one of the most difficult to moderate as well, because well... people wanna fight.  While arguments/disagreements are not something this subreddit moderates for, and there are many healthy discussions from opposite points of view on this sub, all too frequently these conversations end up resulting in rule-breaking behavior like invalidation, derailing, personal attacks, and disrespectful commentary. While like all other topics, we will still moderate for all of our rules (including racism, homophobia, transphobia, and gendered slurs).

That being said, we are going to do something a bit different with this post, is that when this thread is taken down from the announcements, only the top level comments will remain.  If you respond to a commentator to discuss their unpopular opinion, it and any comments related will be removed down the chain.  If you want your opinion to be included in the topic to do so, you will need to make sure your comment is a top-level comment, that answers the question asked, and does not derail the topic to discuss something unrelated (like someone else's answer).

Should I break up with her , give her a break or something like that for these 6 months? She still hasn’t said anything about us breaking up when she leaves. I just don’t know how to expect and what’s the right thing to do since I really don’t want to break up if she leaves but ik she needs to experience what’s out there. I can’t chain her to me. What do you guys think I should do or say to her ? "

What is the probability of the average woman avoiding sexual assault if she fights back?,"Not trying to victim-blame, but the more I read on the male strength, the more horrified I get at the prospect of being a woman.
