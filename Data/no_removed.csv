Any insight on how to handle a coworker trying to set me up with another coworker?,"So over the past month or so, I’ve gotten pretty close with one of my coworkers but never with the intention of dating or getting with her. 

Then today another coworker said they wanted to set me up with someone. I was curious and asked who. She said it was the coworker who I’ve gotten close with, and proceeded to ask if I was into her and things like that. 

I was caught off guard and don’t really know what I should do. I said I’d need to think about it because it got me thinking 

1) why does my coworker want to set us up 
2) was the coworker I’ve gotten close with pushing her to find out what I think of her 
3) say I am interested but then she’s not and what would happen next",0,"Any insight on how to handle a coworker trying to set me up with another coworker?So over the past month or so, I’ve gotten pretty close with one of my coworkers but never with the intention of dating or getting with her.

"Women of reddit, what are you really getting out of it? Even as a straight guy, i can totally get why some women dont like oral.","I just became curious because I saw this porn video where this really nice looking woman was blowing this fat, hairy piece of shit. I mean, she was really going in on it.

I just didn't understand, what is she getting out of it? Dude probably smelled like shit and old coffee, and she probably was picking pubes out of her teeth for days. Yet she was moaning and all that. 

Won't lie, I was disgusted. It actually kinda put me off of receiving oral. If I was in that bad of shape I'd never do any woman the indignity of having to see my horrific form, let alone a bj. Like, there's no way that woman wasn't some sort of call girl. Ugh, gross. 

Ladies, what exactly the appeal of giving? Receiving is rather obvious lol",0,"Women of reddit, what are you really getting out of it?

How far would you go for love?,"I recently was asked out by a guy Im really fond of, but it turns out I will be leaving our state in a few months. There's possibility I may not, but right now it's probably likely. He knows about it, he knew about it weeks before, but still wants to give us a chance. I looked passed a few things that would generally be a deal breaker (for an angel) about finding out about someone, and so did he. I want to hear from another guys' perspective.

How would you react if your barista gave you her number?,"Hi! So I work as a barista and have a regular customer who's really cute and I am usually at register when he comes in the mornings. I was the one to start remembering his name and order and (he also knows my name even when I don't have my name tag on) and we have chatted casually about our lives etc.

He generally just seems like a really sweet guy so I can't tell if he's being his friendly self or if he would be interested in me if I were to write my number on his cup. I really don't want to make him feel uncomfortable or stop coming to our store because I overstepped. It would probably just inconvenience him to find a new location, and I am also pretty risk-averse.

"Guys, do you find it creepy when girls message you on facebook?","So a little back story. I used to work with this guy who I'm totally head over heels with.

I have no idea why, like Im gonna fuck it up or be too awkward or not know what to talk about or not be good enough or something. I'm pretty insecure about my inexperience with sex and women in general and hate to disappoint people, it makes me so nervous.

"How to make friends or be part of a ""crew"" in your 30s+?"," Hi  all - I recently moved to a large metro area in the south and have been finding it difficult to find a consistent group or crew (or even just a friend) to hang out  with. My social life primarily consists of hanging out with coworkers  for the occasional (maybe once every two weeks or month) happy hour.

Before I moved, it was easy and comfortable to find plans with ""the guys"" to do random activities varying from watching a game to  hitting up the bars but I'm not sure whether it's my age or situation  that's making it difficult to find a consistent group of people to hang out with. I'm not the most social person in the world but I consider myself pretty friendly and have pretty common hobbies with a lot of people my age.

It's hitting me particularly hard this week since it'll be the first Super bowl in my adult that I'll likely be watching by myself since I didn't get any invites to the game and it's been hard to break that barrier at work. From other threads,  it seems to be a common theme that as a guy (or girl) in your 30s it  becomes a lot harder to establish social circles and I'm by no means lonely or depressed but it would be nice to be able to just have even a  couple of guys or gals to hang out with regularly and enjoy some things  that have been more fun doing than just by yourself. 

So  the basic question is: for guys in your 30s or older, how have you  managed to become part of a new crew or had success making friendships  later on in life?",0,"How to make friends or be part of a ""crew"" in your 30s+?

Well anyways, one of her friends has always been into me, like it's pretty obvious and even my ex noticed. I also think she's cute, but I've never said anything to her along those lines while I was in a relationship. So as far as I know, she probably has no idea that the feeling is mutual. I know it's probably not the greatest idea in the first place, but is there a good way to tell her I'm also attracted to her and somehow keep it between us?

Knowing that she's also into me, is it likely she'd say something to my ex about me messaging her?"
What are the most awkward things that have happened to you and your SO or ex that became hilarious or a running joke between you?,"I'll start, the first time I went down on my longterm ex she farted in my mouth, not a queef, a full on fart while tongue punching the fartbox and working the clit. I said nothing not wanting to embarrass her, finished my business and it took her almost two years admit that she had. At that point we were well beyond the fart barrier, it became a great joke between us but not as much as the closet joke. When she finally admitted to it she told me that during early dating when I would go to the bathroom she would go into my closet and fart, wave it, then go back into the room before I came back. From then on when we'd fart one of us would say ""did you hear the closet door?"". Even out or at other peoples houses, we would smell a fart and look at each other and one would ask ""the closet"" to see if it was one of us, it was our code.

Started off with the  blonde i was newly dating picking me up in a very expensive car, we talked a while on the way to this shopping plaza we were going for our date, through conversation it came about that she was unemployed,pretty dumb, had an unbelievable amount of money due to her parents being billionaires. I didnt believe her about that last part but when arrived at the shopping center she handed me about 10 grand of ""shopping around money"" then reached in her car and while laughing and smiling at me threw about another 50 grand at me. i was mad for a second because i had something thrown at me,but then realized it was my now GF playfully throwing 50 bands at me and quickly became un-mad. We walked around and she was getting tons of attention due to the fact she was gorgeous and filthy rich with her parents money, she was apperantly well known in the town. there was a TON of jealousy and people thinking i paid her to walk around with me to boost my own personal standing (yea i payed girl with money like that to follow me right?)

How come some dudes act the way they wanna act and look cool and others repulsive and annoying?,"I noticed that it's not even about how tough and good looking they are, but it's about that one thing. 

Something that makes them look just so likable that if they say or do something super messed up they will make you laugh or say/do it, in way that you won't even think that what they are saying/doing is wrong, but support them instead. And when you are around them you just have this feeling that this person is dominating you and everyone around in every way possible. You just have the feeling that if you hit this person something is gonna happen to you afterwards. And for the most of the time you don't really feel like hitting him, because you just get that weird feeling of respect towards him. It's like if this person starts judging you, hitting you or whatever you will immediately start feeling guilty about yourself. It's like even if they have at the moment less money than you just have this one feeling not to mess with him, because tomorrow he might have more money than you and you kinda feel jealous about his struggle.

Then there is the other kind of people who just don't have this one thing and when they act in a way they wanna act they just look annoying, narcissist, creepy and just in general repulsive. When they say or do something messed up they will be judged right away for their decision. And when you're around them even if they are bigger, richer and sometimes more good looking than you , you just don't feel any dominance from them. It's like you can do anything with them and even if they end up beating you up for it you won't really feel the guilt for it. Basically the opposite of the thing I wrote above.

Or to be more specific, how do you become the person above in any circumstances, because here is my situation: To some people I am the confident person mentioned above and some of them actually asked me a similar question that I am writing here. However to some people I am the repulsive guy mentioned below.

advice: guy i’ve recently started dating told me he’s in a funk. how can i be supportive?,"He hasn’t been communicative this week, which is odd because he calls me almost every day and I just spent a wonderful weekend with him.

The next day (yesterday) I asked him if I had done something, and he said no, not at all, that Kobe Bryant’s death struck him.

How can I cut off a friend I like?,"So there is this girl I'm friends with. The problem is that I like her a lot. She trusts me and tells me a lot of her life, even private and really personal stuff.

So I guess it is pretty clear she just sees me as her friend/emotional pillow.

"How do I work on increasing confidence while also not being so ""try hard"" and over analyzing?","I am a 29 yo man. I've made a major shift in my life over the last six months or so. I've been single for about 7 years and decided it was time to actually put a little effort into changing that. I never felt ugly but I also knew that women weren't going to be beating down the door and I was going to need to put in some effort if I wanted to find a mate. And I was okay with that for a while because I was totally obsessed with other things in my life.

So more to the point. Dating and increasing my confidence has been my new obsession over the last 6 months or so. And I've come a long way. But today I noticed something that I haven't noticed before.  I care way more about about how I look now. Which...im not so sure is a great thing some days. Sometimes I feel really confident and other times I feel completely unconfident and down on myself. I realized that I'm so hyper focused on what I look like now and other people's perception and reactions of me that I think it's starting to have the opposite effect. I'm constantly analyzing every little detail when I look in the mirror and now that I'm actually paying attention I'm noticing all the lack of attention I still get from females even though I feel more confident in my appearance.

I've heard it said that ""being comfortable in your own skin"" and not caring so much what others think is attractive. So I feel like I'm at a weird place right now because obviously I do care what people think or I wouldn't be stressing so much about my hair cut, my clothes, cologne etc etc. I hope this makes sense...

Dilemma,"I joined a company 1.5 years back and right after 10 days I saw the most beautiful girl, she was cute, smart and had a cute little pair specs unlike anyone I saw before. I know I am sounding a bit cheesy but trust me I am speaking honestly.

I tried talking to her but I could not come up with any words let alone  form complete sentences so I took the route 1 for introverts and started chatting with her on Facebook, well replies were pretty sporadic and I spent nearly a year like that .  I recently came to know that she has a boyfriend so I was little sad but I always have this one hope of getting her one day. One day someone told her close friends regarding my feelings for her and they confronted me as a result I had to tell them regarding my fondness for her. Recently after 1.5 years I mustered the courage to talk to her but I got to know that her friends who confronted me told her everything about me and also that I have told them to do so. Now she thinks I  don't have courage(which is somewhat true) and I resort to these cheap tactics(which is not at all true). Now I don't have any clue about what to do as she knows the truth but with some wrong things also. Now she avoids me more and she was feeling totally awkward last time(the only time) we talked.

How to get dates?,"I recently got away from a toxic relationship of 9 years on and off (AMA but that's not the point of this post). I am 23 so I have basically no experience dating and pursuing new attractions. I feel comfortable with 1 on 1 social interactions and would love to go on dates and have some fun meeting new women (not really looking for casual sex but I'm open to it). So I have no anxieties about how to behave on dates, however I am finding it extremely difficult to actually *getting* girls to agree to, and follow through on going out with me. 

I do not feel comfortable approaching women in public, partly because I don't want to be seen as creepy and make anyone uncomfortable, but also because there is largely nothing I would want to say to a random stranger that may lead to a date. So I've been mainly using things like tinder. Most of the time women will either not show any interest, or stop showing interest when I bring up the idea of meeting irl. I am incredibly busy with school and haven't had time to try random social activities where I may meet people.

"How do you interact with children in public, if at all?","This has been bothering me lately. I've always been good with kids. I was a camp counselor when I was a teenager at my summer camp. I always knew I wanted kids, and now I have three of them and they're awesome, might even adopt another one someday. 

The issue is that I don't feel like I can interact with them at all in public. If some little kid waves at me in the grocery store or even Disney World, I don't feel I can or should wave back. I've had a few times that were definitely negative experiences. I was at the grocery store and some kid wearing a Pokemon shirt was watching me catch Pokemon on my phone. He was very clearly thrilled by watching this, pointing at it to his mom and such, so I held up the phone and showed him what I caught and the mom turned the cart around. I'm just a normal mid-30's lookin dude, for the record.

I was a camp counselor when I was a teenager at my summer camp. I always knew I wanted kids, and now I have three of them and they're awesome, might even adopt another one someday. 

The issue is that I don't feel like I can interact with them at all in public. If some little kid waves at me in the grocery store or even Disney World, I don't feel I can or should wave back. I've had a few times that were definitely negative experiences. I was at the grocery store and some kid wearing a Pokemon shirt was watching me catch Pokemon on my phone. He was very clearly thrilled by watching this, pointing at it to his mom and such, so I held up the phone and showed him what I caught and the mom turned the cart around. I'm just a normal mid-30's lookin dude, for the record.

Rich girls tend to be better looking. Why is that?,"One of our buddies recently married a young woman from a well-to-do family who live in an affluent suburb. I creeped on his wife's social media and found that not only she but all her friends from this affluent suburb are smoking hot.

How do you experience jealousy in a relationship? How do you communicate it to your partner and what (if any) kind of accommodations do you expect from your partner?,"I dated a guy (32 M) who did not like the fact that I hung out with an ex (it was a very brief relationship that ended amicably years ago, and we’ve been friends ever since and have both moved on, and been with other people, and only meet once in a while)  because “when they see you, they will remember how you looked like naked and this image should only be reserved for me” seeing that we are in an exclusive relationship.  

I felt this was a possessive thing borne out of insecurity and did not accommodate his feelings. I felt he should trust my judgment that there is no threat from that friendship (and other friendships). 

I eventually ended it because I felt our ideas about love and intimacy were not aligned, and I was not convinced I should change my friends or cut them off just to please his ego. 

He often argued (very weakly, I might add) that I do not know “how men think” and therefore should trust his judgment.

(Ugly) Men of Reddit: How do you handle low self-esteem and anxiety before first dates/meetings.,"Sorry for the long post, TLDR at the bottom.

I recently just graduated from University. I've never really had much luck with relationships, after a while I decided to just stop trying and focus on my studies.  Recently I got a dating app and I met this genuinely amazing person literally the first night. We've been talking for a while and it's actually ridiculous how much we have in common, same indie music, favourite movies, even read the same books right before we met. We also had similar dating pasts and are looking for the same thing, she also told me I'm the first person from that app she gave her number too.

Anyways, it's been a week since we've started talking and she's been really pushing meeting irl, we live close enough together so It won't be that much of a problem and we've been talking pretty much every day, even started watching a series together every night while texting. We talked a bit about what we're looking for from dating/relationships and neither of us are too rushed for anything, we'd much rather prefer just spending time and enjoying each others company, likewise, we're not that pressured to jump into a relationship if stuff doesn't work out, and I'd be more than glad to remain her friend if that does happen.

However. I'm a couple of days away and have this overwhelming fear that when we meet everything will change. I've had horrible self-esteem ever since I was a teenager, granted I was probably an ugly kid and bullying happens everywhere but it's shattered some reasonable expectations within my life. She called me cute and awh'ed here and there but whenever I try to compliment her, granted rather jokingly, she'd respond with something like ""lols"" or the likes, it makes me feel stupid for doing so. I tried sending her more ""unedited"" pictures to see if maybe seeing more of me would trigger some sort of reasonable reaction that she's out of my league but she never really comments on my looks, which I mean, is fair, I'm not fishing for compliments, and the pictures usually have other purposes, like showing a haircut etc.

Based on how the conversations and stuff is going we obviously like each other, but I really don't want to meet, if not for all the reasons I listed purely just to not ruin whatever it is that we have, I really like her if you haven't figured out, and I think she's ridiculously way out of my league, it's not even remotely close. And even now I have no idea if she actually finds me attractive, and I wouldn't wish for her to try ""date"" me if she doesn't, I think attraction is a healthy part of any relationship.

I guess what I'm asking is how do you guys get over this. Are leagues something someone should really worry about, it all feels so dumb but a simple ""looks don't matter"" really isn't helping right now, I'm not sure what to do, I think cancelling so close to our meeting would be rude, and me telling her how scared I am might seem too weird/might make meeting weirder for her.

TLDR; I met this amazing girl and we've been talking for a week. She's insanely attractive/ I'm not/ and we have a lot in common.

Growing out long curly hair at 29. Hitting bad awkward stage. How do you deal with the ridicule? Is it worth your rep/first impression being ruined?,"Hey guys need some help.

I Always use to shave my head and felt care free. It helped with my confidence gave me a care free mentality that became apart of my personality and made me more approachable looking back.. and I like the bald head feel but things happened in my life and I got diagnosed with depression and panic phobia and I just stopped caring and wanted a change. I was called pretty boy a lot at jobs with a shaved head and even though I laughed it off I didn't like it much I guess it stuck and during hard time it made me want to see a different person in the mirror hoping it will help.

I let me hair grow and got it cut inbetween but my hair grows in such an awkward twist fashion around my head that it's almost impossible to get it cut right and it's always uneven. The girl that's cutting my hair keeps telling me she can't do much without it taking its natural form before layering it so I'd have to deal with the awkward stage for half a year.

I'm also wearing Invisalign which is straightening and moving around teeth which prohibits me to talk as my normal self so words are coming out sounding different, just a bad look all around.

How would you handle a situation in which you suspect your friend has a crush on your girlfriend?,"My friend/roommate made some comments tonight about him having a big crush on her, but he's playing it off as sarcasm. When I tried to get semi serious with him for a second he said he was just joking, but my other roommate and I both agree that this is exactly how he'd act if he really felt this way, and when we confronted him about it he just acted like we're overreacting at a simple joke. Lately he's also been talking about how lonely he is since he broke up with his girlfriend recently, and he's talked to my girlfriend about this too. She's one of the nicest people on Earth, and we've all been friends for a while, but I've always been of the opinion that a single man (especially a lonely one) cannot be just friends with a woman, even if that woman is dating their friend. Extra worrying because that's how I got my current girlfriend. I became friends with her when her relationship was bad, and she left her boyfriend for me. So yeah I've been pretty honest with her about my opinion on that sort of thing. 



I've been suspicious of this happening for a while since we can't really avoid hanging out with him when I take her back to my place. Our relationship is pretty healthy, and I don't think she's lying when she tells me I'm her best relationship she's had. She did cheat on her high school boyfriend years ago, so that sticks out as a red flag, but overall I do trust her.

I'm actually not really worried about my friend doing anything right now because he's a really nice, loyal dude (not gonna lie, it's strange that he's single, he's a really solid catch), but I'm also not stupid, and I know how feelings develop. I don't think she'd be mad if I brought up the possibility of him having a crush, but she might (probably unlikely at this point) disagree and think their friendship is harmless. Although if she did say that I'd probably dump her right there because I'm pretty sure she's had sex with every guy ""friend"" she's ever had, and was even friends with her ex for a while. I'm more worried that it would put her in a weird position where she can't really do anything.

How do y’all feel about inexperienced girls using dating apps?,"So I’m a 24F that hasn’t been in a relationship ever. Never gone on a date either. Never done anything pretty much lol.

How did you benefit from having an abusive father?,"My step father was a totally abusive prick all throughout my teens and into my early 20’s. He would violently get into my face and scream at me or get mad at me for any small thing that inconvenienced him or annoyed him.

Why do men get married?,"Hey guys! I’m recently engaged, and very happy. I (28f) am totally in love with my fiancé (39m). He’s a wonderful man, and we’ve been through some intense highs and lows in the three years we’ve been together. We decided to stick together and make it permanent.

I’ve been wondering a lot though... I’ve seen very few relationships stand the test of time. My parents split, my grandparents split, every aunt and uncle, most close friends I’ve had... it seems like everyone eventually gets divorced. 

It’s very discouraging to see people make the leap, trusting each other with their hearts, bodies, homes, family and finances, then fall apart.

Marriage seems like a particularly bad deal for men. Not that I’m the type to chase him down for half his stuff if it doesn’t work, but a lot of women do. And don’t get me started about the legal issues that get kids taken from their fathers. It’s heartbreaking.

How would you feel about dating a woman who works part time because of mental health issues?,"28F with diagnosed bipolar and anxiety disorders here (the bipolar is mostly under control with meds and therapy, so it’s mainly the anxiety that’s the issue). I only work a part time job, because I get overwhelmed working too many hours. I’ve been working the same job for over 3 years now, and although the pay is low, I really love this job. I do hope to work full time someday, but I don’t feel ready yet, and to be honest, I don’t know if I ever will.

I was in a relationship for almost 5 years until last year, when my ex broke up with me. We had been talking about moving in together, but he wanted a certain lifestyle that he wouldn’t be able to afford on mostly his income. For the record, despite him making about 8x my salary, I paid for all my own meals and date activities for the whole duration of the relationship, so I’m not a leech or looking for a sugar daddy. I even paid for him occasionally, because I felt it was fair, considering he did all of the driving due to my driving anxiety. I tried to contribute to the relationship in other ways by doing thoughtful things for him, planning free or cheap dates, etc.

"Gamers of Reddit, how many hours do you typically play your game/s a day?","Hi guys, legit curious. My boyfriend seems to really like playing his video games a lot.

What does your average weekday and weekend routine look like? Also - what's your age and occupation?,"Just curious to see what an average weekday and weekend looks like for everyone. I'll start.
I'm 26 and a nurse. My average weekday routine (Monday to Thursday) is waking up at 6am, studying until 8am, getting to work for around 9. Home from work around 3-4, an hour or two of charting, off to the gym and then dinner with the wife. Wednesdays are weekly dart nights with the boys. 



Weekends that I don't work (Thursday-Friday) I'm up by 8, at the gym by 9 and back home around 10. Make a big breakfast, spend a few hours studying, then figure out how we'd like to spend the weekend. Sometimes its daytrips, parties / events if there's anything going on, or a weekend trip to Toronto to visit my good friend. Most weekends we're productive-ish in the day, then as soon as its dark we like to get stupidly high and play videogames or watch a movie. Summers are similar, except I play baseball twice a week.

How long do you generally wait to set up dates 1-5?,"So I made a post the other day about a girl who canceled our 2nd date last Friday and rescheduled for Tuesday of this week.

How do you act differently around a female friend to make it clear you’re just interested in being friends?,"We’ve seen the countless posts wondering ‘is he flirting?’ ‘how do I know if he’s flirting or being friendly?’ etc. But those questions and answers are usually framed in terms of what hints to look for that indicate flirting.

What I’m wondering is the flip side: guys, when you know or suspect that a female friend is into you, but you’re NOT interested like that, what do you do or say to communicate that? Do you act any differently?

Let’s assume the guy in question is interested in women and not in a relationship, because “I’m gay” or “I have a girlfriend/partner/SO” seem like obvious solutions to this problem, but they may not always apply.

I ask because as a woman, I recognize a lot of the different ways women hint or signal to men ‘just friends’ or ‘not interested,’ but I don’t know what it looks like for guys in that situation.

Edit: Please no joke answers about how this never happens because all straight men are always horny for all women. Maybe you are, but if that’s the case then this isn’t the question for you.

How can I get along with my bf's friends despite our age gap (10yr)?,"I (F 20) have just met my bf (M 30)'s friends and I don't know if they can accept me, due to our age gap. I really like my bf, I'm aware of how complicated a relationship with such an age gap could be and I know it has more chances of not lasting long, but I just want to enjoy things till they work. 
I know his friends and I are in different phases of life and that we don't have a ton of thing in common (e.g. they work while I study, they live on their own while I'm still at my parents house...), so it could be more difficult to become part of the group. However I want to be part of my bf's world and he wants it too, so I think it's very important to find a way to get along with his fellows and their gfs. 
When I met them I felt that on the one hand they kinda disapproved our relationship (I can understand it, I know age gap relationship have to face social disapproval), but on the other they pointed out pretty often how happier my bf seemed since we started dating.
I don't know how to behave

So basically, I was his first date and I also initiated his first kiss. I looove hugs so I hug him all the time and I like to wrap my arms around him from behind and do the awkward waddle paddle walk. I did all of the first move since he was too shy and had no dating experience.

Whats the move here?,"Met this chick, hung out with her twice, she def expressed interest in hanging out again (non platonic way) both times we hung out, asked her to come thru at a bar with me and some friends, she said she didnt have a way to get there at the moment but if she did she would be down, asked her if shes free this weekend and she said shes working.

Seems like totally legitimate reasons, but it also feels weird to ask her out to something else after it not working out these past two times, 

Unsure of how to procede, should I ask her if there is a time specifically she is available to work better around her schedule, or just leave it be.

Feels desperate to ask a chick out 3 times, but she was definitely into me when we were hanging out before. Specifically said she had a lot of fun and said we should hangout again.

I sorta just wanna be straight up and ask if shes about it, or if she changed her mind or something and doesnt want to hang out anymore, just seems like an awkward thing to say.

Low body fat but abs not showing,"So I’m 16, 5”7, 127lbs and I have just started working out for the first time the last couple months doing calisthenics and have noticed great results.

Sorry if that sounds really harsh but I can't tell her that. Might immediate reaction (after prepping myself by taste testing when she wasn't in the room) was to say I need to teach her how to make sauce.

In my defense this food is inedible. I just don't know how to console her or respond to the ""everyone else likes it"" when there's no way that could be true.

Sorry if that sounds really harsh but I can't tell her that. Might immediate reaction (after prepping myself by taste testing when she wasn't in the room) was to say I need to teach her how to make sauce.

In my defense this food is inedible. I just don't know how to console her or respond to the ""everyone else likes it"" when there's no way that could be true.

She's upset and I'm legitimately not hungry and she doesn't believe me either. Timing couldn't be worse there. What would you guys do in this situation? I said I should teach her to make sauce."

casual dating or strictly a booty call?,"i figured it would be best to get a guy's perspective on this. 

so i (27F) have been casually seeing this one guy 29M for the past few weeks. first date went well and we set up a second, which went well too and ended with us sleeping together, and led to a third date that ended the same way right before the holiday season. 

holidays came and went and we've only been able to see each-other once since then and he literally just invited me over to his apartment to have sex. 🤷

no shame in that but in-between then there's been some sexting and a little bit of texting but tbh we've never texted much, only to make plans to hangout. 

what throws me off is that this guy got out of an 8+ yr relationship like 7 months before we met and i'm the first person he's been with apparently. 

so my question is — does this come off as some kind of casual thing or more of a rebound booty call thing? 

i mean obviously i'd have to ask him where we stand, i'd just appreciate some feedback cause lately i feel like i've been going nuts wondering wtf is going on.",0,"casual dating or strictly a booty call?i figured it would be best to get a guy's perspective on this.

"Girlfriend Abusive, testing me? What am I dealing with?","TL;DR

1 year+ into the relationship and first like for ""real"" relationship but i know in reality it isn't because of our age.
I am 20, she's 18.

Me and my girlfriend that are in long distance used to talk and call every day. 
Maybe lately I was too available for her and It probably annoyed her. She made me also lose trust, and made me like controlling and suspect her I admit it's not good any tips for that? Let me know please. 

It let to her respond slower at first, and not answer calls directly.

So I talked about it and she now suddenly tells me calling every day is not right and that she didn't want to see me every day and also she was bored and easily irritated. I told her you need space? She tells me no, I'm not taking space from relationship and tells me ""I always love you"" but i know she is also influenced by her sisters and talking about me behind my back.

She became emotionally distant.

Is she testing me to see if i can live without her?

""Remember before it all happened it came in stages and this is the aftermath""

Day 1: Almost no response 3 times maybe. And a 1 missed call of her just because i wanted but she didn't look interested. I called her later  instead and a pop up came she was in another call and she still didn't respond to my text. So I called her out, called her ""devil"" for treating me like this and then ""she"" wanted to throw a tantrum for me saying that it took her very long to reply. The next day she says I wasn't on a ""call"" later she admits she called and tells me it's not a boy or something like that but ""someone important"" childish right?. I think either she was testing me or something really happened.
On this day It took her hours to reply at certain times. Sometimes 5 or 6!!! But I didn't feel any remorse because basically it made me think she is not worth it and i accepted mentally that she isn't my girlfriend anymore. And shockingly when watching a random youtube video, and saw a girl talking and my brain said this: that's what my ""ex would think"" i said it unconsciously to myself.

So i told her why are you still behaving like that? She told me I'm not gonna break up with you and I am not seeing someone else. ""But i don't believe it"" I don't really care that much anymore, because she pushes me away. And to be honest i am more hurt for getting treated this way.

Day 2: I wasn't gonna initiate any texts anymore. We didn't even talk or something but she kept me up to date sometimes on what she was doing and more then the first day. And tells me at the end of the day, sorry that I didn't have much time for you,""I love you always"". (I got really pissed because it isn't true) but I held it in me, and told her kindly just goodnight."" She tells me I call you tomorrow. But i am not excited at all to see her and feel like ignoring or maybe worse breaking up. I know that even if she will call me, she would still be slow responsive and not call me everyday and treat me like dirt.

Conclusion:

1. She says im not taking space but she isn't putting any effort into relationship, But she tells me she isn't. Is my girlfriend trying to convince me her behaviour is normal? We used to call every day and text eachother because we are in long distance.

2. Any hope left of her behaving like she used to be? Is this a phase?

I didn't have problems with us seeing often because of the distance. But it isn't right. I cannot see the person ""i love"" but she clearly is not the same anymore.  She just told me i love you and i always do. But words is nothing, it's just words it doesn't make me feel in love or give me hope. Because of the way i get treated i find it manipulative and abusive is she abusing me?

I know it's not true what she says and how she behaves. It's like she is changing the rules for her own favour and I feel tested.

Any advice?

"What's your take on this list titled ""Men, you want to treat women better? Here's a list to start with.""?","Talk to your friend who is “kind of a creep” at work.

Don’t talk over women.

If you are asked to be on a panel/team and see that it’s all men, say something. Maybe even refuse the spot!

When you see another guy talk over a woman, say: “Hey, she was saying something.”

Learn to read a fucking room.

Don’t call women “crazy” in a professional setting.

Don’t use your “feminism” as a way to get women to trust you. Show us in your day-to-day life, not in your self-congratulatory social media.

Don’t touch women you don’t know, and honestly, ask yourself why you feel the need to touch women in general.

Do you feel that any woman on earth owes you something? She doesn’t. Even if you’re like, “Hm, but what about basic respect?” ask yourself if you’ve shown her the same.

Don’t send pictures of your penis unless she just asked for them.

If a woman says no to a date, don’t ask her again.

If a woman has not given an enthusiastic “yes” to sex, back the hell off.

If a woman is really drunk, she cannot consent to you and she also cannot consent to your buddy who seems to be trying something. Your buddy is your responsibility, so say something and intervene.

If you do the right thing, don’t expect praise or payment or a pat on the back or even a “thank you from that woman”. Congratulations, you were baseline decent.

Involve women in your creative projects, then let them have equal part in them.

Don’t make misogynistic jokes.

Don’t expect women to be “nice” or “cute” and don’t get upset when they aren’t those things.

Don’t make assumptions about a woman’s intelligence, capabilities or desires based on how she dresses.

Pay women as much as you pay men.

If a woman tells you that you fucked up, and you feel like shit, don’t put it on that woman to make you feel better. Apologize without qualification and then go away.

Don’t punish women for witnessing your vulnerability.

Don’t get defensive when you get called out.

Don’t need to literally witness a man being horrible in order to believe that he’s horrible. Trust and believe women.

Don’t use your power to get women’s attention/company/sex/etc.

Be aware of your inherent power in situations and use it to protect women, especially via talking to other men.

Stop thinking that because you’re also marginalized or a survivor that you cannot inflict pain or oppress women.

If women’s pain makes you feel pain, don’t prize your pain above hers, or make that pain her problem.

I (23F)  am going out with this guy (26M) for around 3 weeks now. We've met around 5/6 times already and had sex on the second date.
He's pretty nice, handsome, sweet etc. We get along and being spending some pretty nice time together.

Like he don't say anything and also I really can't tell lol so happened some times that I am there on top (which is super often bc I really like it) and then I asked if he cum already and he says yeah? But then means we were having sex with the condom filled which is not safe and weird lol any advice of how to talk to him and any ideas of why he doesn't say anything?? 

2 - I really like some more kinky stuff like choking, slapping, hair pulling, etc etc, but he seems to be pretty vanilla on bed. The sex is good but I really miss something more rough.

What is the best way to deal with bedhead?,"I generally shower during the afternoon/evening and then get into bed. When I wake up my hair (indian, lots of volume) tends to get plastered up in various directions. It isnt greasy or anything, but no amount of plain water fixes it. In order to get it to lay back in its usual hairstyle, i have to full on wash my head with soap and hot water, dry off, and then comb it.

is there a faster/easier way to fix it? Its not really a huge deal for most mornings, I just bend over the tub or sink, or worst case scenario i'll just hop in and take a full on second shower. But it does become a problem during the warmer months when im also attempting to fix helmet hair. Or when i get that dent in it from wearing headphones all day.

Is this a sign of shyness or...?,"Before you read this: Sorry if i’m overthinking this, i’m really bad at this kind of stuff.

So there’s this girl in my Spanish class who’s pretty cute, i’ve noticed her a week or two ago because i saw her glancing at me. Ever since then i’ve seen her looking at me whenever i walk past her in the hall or in class. Today i had class with her and i tried to see if she was still showing those signs.

Today it was a bit different though which kind of discouraged me to talk to her. I tried getting her attention as everyone was walking out of class (I was in the front left part of the room and she was in the back left part), she was on my right and i noticed she was kind of looking past me as if she was looking through her corner of her eye. And there wasn’t really much to see where she was looking at apart from just chairs and tables.

I have no idea what i should do. Should i just forget about it or should i consider talking to her? Thanks in advance!",0,"Is this a sign of shyness or...?Before you read this: Sorry if i’m overthinking this, i’m really bad at this kind of stuff.

When you can sense your guy friend is now into you,This seems to happen to me a lot.. some of my guy friends at one point or another suddenly are into me. Which always ruins things.

How do I develop empathy?,"Hello ladies and gents of r/AskMen

Over the past few years, I feel that I have become more and more jaded towards life and have developed a don't care attitude toward a lot of things.

How have the energy levels changed in your relationships as they have progressed?,"What I mean is, at the start of a relationship when you date etc it's extremely exciting of course as you're meeting a new person and finding out about them, always excited to see them etc, but what about later?

22 years old and petrified of judgement from meeting a woman,"Hi, when i was 15 i got diagnosed with one of the worst cases of OCD which basically destroyed important years of my life, i had to drop out of school to get constant therapy it took me over 3 hours to just sleep and over 1000 obsessive habits a day. 6 years later after insane amount of work i finally recovered from OCD and it is completely gone now.

But i've spent these last 6 years basically being inside, i never really went out or did anything and now that im better i wanna do a lot of things, one of them is going on a date. But i am completely petrified of doing it because im afraid of being judged.

I'm 22 years old, never kissed a girl, been on a date or lived any kind of normal life because i spent all this time just battling OCD, im afraid of someone thinking its weird, i just wanted to ask any woman my age or even older from past experience, would you date someone in a situation like this? Is it weird would you be creeped out?

This has just been making me really depressed but i don't know if its my mind over-analyzing it when its not the case. I have no fear of social interaction, im just afraid of being looked at as some kind of freak...

Does she love me,"So I've been freinds with her for a few months now and ive been crushing for near a month now , now for backstory, I get invited to hang by someone who I didn't like but he liked me (as a friend) he had someone ""REALLY COOL"" to show me. I went and she was fucking great to hangout with, she was a REAL freinds. After awhile I started crushing on her and normally I'd just ask her out but she was gay and I fucked up explaining to her I'm bi not gay but she thought it was cool to have a gay none attracted to her Freind,( this is a small conservative town 2000&gt; people) and her other two freinds were attracted to her, I'm head over heels for her and I  think she has it for me too, she is prone to touching me, we hangout everyday we play around sexylly (me fake hitting her and she saying harder daddy) she talks about hateing being gay, and regreting not asking people out, she opens up to me, is polite to me (more than others) and doesn't care if I touch her kitty or nipps when we wresle, she is comfy with me holding her little sister, (rare) and more but that is the most important. But she very clearly likes women she has dry fucked her ex when she dating in front of me IDK what that means. She has had gfs, she liked girls but does she like men. When I ask her I she likes me she says thats how she treats her friends (not 100% on that) I love her for more than her looks and Wana make a move but I might lose my only Freind if she says no. IDK if I wouldn't kill myself (prescibed depressed not e boy depressed) I have little I'm in poverty in a town that hates me for fake Bs rumours so she is all I got. Aka If y'all fuck up I might die.

Are men willing to commit to a serious relationship while being a student in university?,"Me, female / mid 20s. 

I'm trying to figure out if it's something that's possible or if people are generally closed off to the idea. I yearn for a sincere relationship where you grow with your partner. I want to have a good time, learn together, build each other up, explore, laugh, cuddle, resolve differences with quality communication, bond intimately, etc. I dont want it to be superficial and temporary, I want to make an investment. I'm tired of witnessing the general population (in my age group) lack desire to be monogamous and committed. I mean, to each their own, I dont judge. It's just extremely hard finding someone who shares my desires of the real thing. Seems like most people just want to focus on themselves and not go out of their way to make things work. I'm aware I'm generalizing, this is just my anecdotal experience. 

Speaking for yourself, would you be willing to commit to someone and make it work even if it's logistically difficult? 

E.g. I'm from LA and will be in SD for 2 years and unsure where I'll end up after. If I'm in a genuine relationship, I would be willing to make it work and compromise where my partner and I lived. Is that not the common consensus? Do people just want to study with their heads down and/or have casual flings and date when they're more settled? If you find something worth fighting for, would you choose not to?

I maintain excellent grades and am able to commit without dragging anyone down, including myself. Do people fear a relationship would jeopardize their education?",0,"Are men willing to commit to a serious relationship while being a student in university?Me, female / mid 20s.

How do I deal with my first big heartbreak?,"I've been talking to this girl for about 4 months, we pretty much clicked instantly and got to know each other really well and honestly I think I fell in love. On New Years I asked her out and she said yes, we continued to date and it was kind of long distance (she lived about 2 hours away from I did, but that didn't stop me from seeing her as much as possible) which made things a little difficult at times. I even changed my mind about which university I wanted to go to just so that I could be closer to her. Unfortunately she's recently had a hard time adjusting to her life as we've both just finished High School and are getting ready to pursue a career or continue studying at a university. 
This hardship has pushed her to the point of breaking up with me, despite all that I've said to ease her and attempt to look for a different solution she's decided it's best that she stays single for now. I understand it may be what she needs and I don't wish her any hardship because I can see the problem from her side of the coin as well as my own. What I don't understand is why I feel so bad, like I've been pushed around and fucked over. I really liked this girl, and it wasn't like any of my previous relationships, this girl was special. Unfortunately she's a bit stubborn like me so she won't be getting back together with me until she stitches her life back together.
She's stated that I haven't lost her and that she wishes to try again when all is well. As much as I like her I'm not too sure about this idea, I feel like if we got back together in say 6 months it would be awkward and it wouldn't work as well as it has this first time.

Men of reddit, what do I do? I'm now stuck in a university I only chose because of her, I can't stop thinking about her and breaking down and I'm not sure about getting back together after a break, despite my feelings for her.

In October we ironed things out and he said that he would like us to try to work things out. We agreed to start slowly and eventually work things out.

Three weeks after they met they had sex he swears it means nothing it was just him blowing off steam and he swears that he still loves me. My question is should I be worried because they still hangout and talk daily.",0,"The other womanHey so I have been dating this guy for the past 3 years.

Why is it so difficult to give men advice?,"I'm gonna make a big rant. But oh boy, I really find it difficult to give other men advice. btw I'm a man. And my issue is this, some people in this sub ask for advice and all. That's great and all. But then I found some thread with the title ""The common lies in this sub"". I agreed with some comments like when some dude say I have big dick or how many woman he gets. But what pisses me off is they categorized as lies the advice that some people gave to them. Like realtionship advice and advice on life, they just shit on that. Like saying ""relationship is like a straight line, but it's damn hard"", or saying ""those dudes who give advice like they have it figured it out"".

That kinda stuff is grinding my gears, some people want to give a helping hand, tried their best to help other but some are just whiny little shit who just keep complaining. 

Another one I found on another sub with this quesion""What is the point of life when you're not rich"". Many other people tried their best to help this dude. Because he may had some issues, but guess what he just kept saying that their advice was shit and all. You may have a bad day, but that stuff is messed up. People want to genuinely help but nope, this dude just want to complain about life. WHy in the first place did you put this question? It's so stupid and assholish to just begin a thread and just shitting on people advice. 

Life is not supposed to be easy, it's not damn fair, but you have to work hard to own it. I was the kinda who kept complaining like those dudes. But then I stopped complaining, worked hard and it was painful but in the end it was wort it.

How to deal with my best friend moving away,"My best friend is leaving soon to go to Mexico for a study abroad trip, and I just said goodbye to him tonight until the next time I see him in June. I haven’t been handling it very well. He’s my smoking buddy, movie-watching buddy, 3AM trip to the grocery store buddy, and I’m gonna lose all of that for 5 months. I have other good friends here at college, so it’s not like I’ll be entirely alone, but I worry that not having him around is something I won’t be able to get over. Luckily, the silver lining in all of this is that him leaving will make me focus really hard on school, which is important for me with it being my first semester of nursing school. I’ll smoke way less, probably eat healthier, and hopefully focus more on school. I know that it’s for the best because it’s important to him. He feels like living in the US sucks (and frankly it kinda does) and he thinks his life is just gonna be fucking incredible when he lives there. He mentioned to me last night when we had dinner at one of our favorite places for the last time that if he loves it when he’s down there, he’s considering staying down there permanently. Obviously I’d love for him to get to live a better life, but I know mine would be really hard without him. I know I’m probably being a little bitch for getting upset about my friend leaving for only a few months, but it’s torn me down today. I listened to Dark Side of the Moon (one of our favorite albums) and I cried a lot. These next few months are gonna be interesting to say the least, and I’m not ready for such a drastic change (with him leaving and nursing school starting). Maybe I’ll get a girlfriend and replace him lol",0,"How to deal with my best friend moving awayMy best friend is leaving soon to go to Mexico for a study abroad trip, and I just said goodbye to him tonight until the next time I see him in June.

How do I stop guys from harassing me.,"Hi,

I'm a 19 year old girl and I'm south-east asian. I dress modestly and am quiet religious. I try to limit my interactions with guys and lead a righteous lifestyle.

However, I can't help how I look or how my body looks. I have tan skin, black hair, and a pretty curvy figure. This has made guys refer to me as Mia Khalifa since 9th grade. As someone who is devoted to being modest, this reality made me really depressed in the past

I even changed schools, attending three different high schools but this harassment and nickname continued to follow me. I now attend college and still get harassed. I always attract the wrong attention and the wrong guys no matter how modestly I dress.

I tried cutting my hair and getting contact lenses to change my look but it has done nothing. Girls sometimes spread rumors about me just because of my shape also. 

I get cat called and have been in rather dangerous situations with guys following me home or crowding me. How can I get guys to stop harassing me? Why am I always such an easy target?

She started her graduate studies in Neuroscience for a PhD, and I was finishing up my undergraduate studies for computer science (just graduated). The first time I met her, we were getting to know each other and it was a blast: we had so much in common, she was intelligent, funny, and beautiful. About a week in, we started hooking up. And a week later, she asked me if I am her boyfriend, and I said yes. But there were multiple major red flags diving deep into the relationship.


Red flags: she told me that she had been contacting her long term ex-boyfriend as a friend and seemingly hasn’t moved on from him (he’s about 300 miles away from our college town), she always hides her phone screen from me whenever I’m near her presence, and one of my friends found her Tinder profile still up 7 weeks into dating her..

So by the time it was almost finals and the semester was about to end, the day before her birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to tag her in a “In a Relationship” status just to surprise her. I mean, 8 weeks into dating and we were working on something together, so I felt it was the right time. This backfired, and she told me that she likes to keep her private life “private”. She then had to explain to her friends, family, Mom, and ex about me. I apologized and tried to explain that it was a mistake, but she replied by blocking me on Facebook (probably to hide any ties with her)

I thought this was odd. A week after this conundrum, we spent some time together in her apartment, and while we were getting ready for bed, she asked me to give her her phone downstairs. I thought to myself that this was the moment I get to know the truth. I started snooping (unacceptable, but necessary) her messages and I found a text message from a guy who asked if she’s down for dinner while we were dating. She didn’t respond to him (or she probably deleted her responses), but I confronted her about it. She then said to me “if you think I’m cheating on you, you should leave”. She then broke down, and I said it’s okay, trying to calm her down since she was having panic attacks

The next early morning while she was sleeping, things didn’t add up to me, so I managed to snoop her phone again. This time, I found out she’s been in contact with multiple guys in the area through text (comprising of when she’s available in the evenings) and her matching on Tinder (no flirtatious messages). But the worst of it all, her text message to her ex boyfriend made my heart palpitate. She explained to him that the “In a Relationship” status was fake, claiming that I “was a graduate student who wanted her attention and stalk her or something”. Then her ex suggested to talk shit about me if she had any mutual friends

I confronted her about it, she threatened to call the police on me but she cried and tried to explain her innocence , and I naively forgave her.

So the next day, I sent her an essay of wanting to break up with her going along the lines of “I’m breaking up with you. You’re cheating on me, and I want my things back”
She said in reply “Thank you for all the bullshit assumptions and for saying I love you about an hour ago, was that just to play with my emotions? Nice to know literally everything wanting to be with me meant nothing. Goodbye, OP”
She then explained to me that she uses Tinder because she’s conceited and prideful, that she uses for attention.
I then, out of misery, said that I still love her. And she replied back with “And I still love you”

We then agreed to keep each other as “friends for now” the following day because we obviously have strong feelings for each other. 

So after graduation and during Christmas break, I burned a lot of bridges and crossed boundaries from our “break”. I sent her an essay demanding for reciprocal love during her time in work, instead of calling her I showed up unexpectedly to her apartment to ask if she’s moving on (and to get my things back), and my phone call conversations always consisted of me asking her if she still loves me and everything. Then I accused her that “I know you’ve moved on” after I found her Tinder profile 8 days ago. She said in reply that my accusations are narrative, that I am putting her on edge all of the time, and that she dearly loved me. And this caused her to block me partially everywhere. After realizing I’ve been blocked on my phone, I frantically started freaking out and was delirious. I managed to contact her via email, asking for a way to elaborate and clarify that I still trust her. She then sent me the following email:  

“I’m sorry, I literally don’t know what else to do. I’m just sitting here crying and I can’t keep doing this. I feel like you keep me on edge all of the time because I never know what you might do or say. You take narratives and run with them. I start my classes tomorrow morning and I don’t think it would be helpful if we talked right now, but I also don’t think it would be helpful in general if we were talking at all for the time being. Please understand. I’m so sorry, I don’t know how to handle this. I think you are an awesome, amazing person and I would like to talk again, but stuff like this keeps happening and it’s not okay. This hurts me so much, and I know it must hurt you too, but I think it's for the best. You will always be in my heart. Please take care of yourself and be safe. Don't isolate yourself. Talk with your friends and relatives. I'm going to get better too and everything will be okay. Maybe in the future we can talk again, I don't know, but I do know that I need to be okay first.”

I then replied her that I’ll respect her well-being, that I agree that this is probably the best for both of us, and that I dearly loved her and I’m sorry that I’ve been a shitty guy. 

Shen then told me “I appreciate that. Also, I don’t think you’re a shitty guy so please don’t beat yourself up over anything. Thank you for understanding.”

I can’t get over her. It felt like our love was real. But, I don’t even know anymore.

What is up with my boyfriend?,"Men are so confusing. I'm (21f) in a long distance relationship of two years with my boyfriend (22), lately he has been odd, not distance but not super lovey dovey which is fine. But after nagging him to look at his syllabus which he just got about six days ago to see when he can come see me he finally did. He was suppose to come see me this coming month but claims he is too busy and it will have to be March. I just suggest that I can come see him then. He then said he didn't want to do that because he would have almost no time to spend with me and if we are going to spend all that money and time and effort then he wants it to be when he can actually spend time with me. I don't care, just seeing him and being next to him is good enough for me, at least at night I'll be able to hold him and be close to him. I understand this is a busy semester for him, but he can almost never answer my calls and I'm always waiting for him to call. Again I'm fine with that but what makes me upset is that he doesn't say anything that sweet or sincere or does anything to make me feel loved. I try to communicate how I feel and ask him to just be affectionate and he says okay but nothing really changes. He almost seems like he isn't as in love with me as he use to.  I understand he is busy but something feels off. I know he doesn't want to break up, I actually almost broke up with him because it was so bad I didn't think he was as interested as he use to be. I use to get ""you're so pretty"" or ""you make me happy' or just sweet little things that like that even when he is busy  But now nothing. So if he doesn't want to break up and still loves me....what the hell is going on??",0,"What is up with my boyfriend?Men are so confusing.

How to deal with someone that is super cocky and always talking shit?,"so i workout with a group of people. this one dude is 6’2, 320lbs. to be brutally honest, he is fat and out of shape. yet he swears to god he is “super swole”, the “strongest in the gym”, he’s a “absolute unit” (he says all that stuff). the dude is delusional and for some reason actually believes that he is “swole”, “ripped”, and “one of the strongest in the gym”. im 5’8, 160lbs, around 12% body fat. him and i almost lift the same weight.

i got on the scale and it was 161lbs, and he goes “dude you are so small. how are you only 160”. one of the other guys backed me up and said that was a good weight for me and saying that i’m putting on size. then the other guy was like “yeah but he’s not swole like me”. i’m tired of this clown talking shit so i said “sorry i’m not fat like you. you need to loose a lot of weight then you can come talk to me”. then he got all pissed. then one of the guys was talking about what they were having for dinner and this dude goes “yeah you need to get out of here and go eat too with your small ass”. so i told him he needs to go home and skip a few meals for a weak and maybe he will loose some weight.

Employee giving me cold shoulder because I was interested in her before.... what should I do?,"I made the cardinal sin of trying to date a coworker.  I was friendly with this girl on my team and I decided to bit the bullet and ask her out.  She wasn't interested.  It was disappointing...sure... but I didn't pursue it anymore after that.

I am not interested in her anymore but I still try to be friendly.  I try to say good morning and good-bye.  I tried to make chit chat but she's giving me the cold shoulder every time.  I am not saying she has to be my friend but her attitude is causing the work environment to be very awkward and unpleasant to work in.  It's easy to say just keep things professional and only focus on work related tasks but it's not that simple.  I feel her motivation will drop because of this environment and why have such a tense work environment when it doesn't seem to benefit anyone?  I tried having a 1-on-1 meeting with her, just to know her better and get to know more about her work and her goals just like any good manager would, but she only gave one word answer.

How should you help your best friend with heartbreak,"For context, one of my best friends is a poor starving artist who's trying to make it in life. We decided that we would open up a company together. He has pretty low self-esteem as his family has never treated him right and always treated him like a failure for being a poor starving artist. He never really had the greatest grades in school and has been pretty down on his luck his whole life and it doesn't help that we've known each other for most of our lives and I've always been relatively successful in most of my endeavors like school and stuff and so he has always had his family compare him to me (which was not my intention at all. I just have a strict family, so I had to do well), but he's a genuinely nice guy and has helped me out many times.

So my best friend fell in love with a girl, but the girl decided to end their relationship after kinda playing around with his heart. He's been pretty devastated and has been down on his luck this whole time. He talked to me about his self-worth and how he felt himself growing older and not having much success in life and how he has always felt like a failure and how the girl playing with him made him feel worthless as though there was nothing good nor talented about him. It's an odd thing; even if he's my best friend and not family, his pain felt as if it were my pain, almost as though the girl had played with me instead of him. I didn't know exactly how to help with it, so I told him what I personally thought about relationships myself. I personally believe that relationships are there to test compatibility and that it's better to test them sooner rather than later, however I felt that it was a crummy - perhaps too logical answer, and don't believe I helped cheer him up. So I I said that I would be there for him and that if he needed me I would talk. I'm not sure what else I can do about it but it's painful seeing him so down when I know he's got immense talent within himself even if no one else thinks he does.",0,"How should you help your best friend with heartbreakFor context, one of my best friends is a poor starving artist who's trying to make it in life.

Bf broke up but wants to be friends?,"
When we broke up he said he didn’t want to end on a bad note and that he still wants me in his life, just as a friend. He briefly offered we could just take a break but I was just like if you want to break up than we’ll break up and he didn’t press it further
He said the reason he wanted to break up was I flirted with a guy several months ago and while he’s been trying to trust me it’s been really hard (especially since I’m in the military so I’m away from him surrounded by a bunch of guys several days a month)

Does he like me or am i overreacting?,"I bumped into this guy who i went to hs with at the airport. We’ll call him Drew. We never really talked before but we did have mutual friends. Anyway, we both had some small talk and found out that we were both heading to Hawaii on the same flight. During this time I was pregnant and meeting my boyfriend in Hawaii while Drew was meeting up with his parents. Not only were we on the same flight but we were actually seated together! At the time, I was annoyed cause I’m pregnant and I was hoping to catch some sleep. We ended up talking the whole flight (5 hours). I kept the conversation going because I hate awkward silence. Anyway, people around us would congratulate us thinking that we were a couple but before i could correct them, he went along with it by thanking people. I thought it was innocent jokes so i didnt care. 

After the flight, he texted me saying that he still couldn’t believe that we were seated next to each other and claimed it was “fate”. 

A month later I find out that we were both taking the same online college course. I had just given birth so I have a family. Over the course of the semester he texted me everyday talking about his family, what he was doing, and even about his bio mom abandoning him. Our conversations would go on the whole day until 2am. Im up at this time of course cause I have a newborn. I just thought he needed a friend to rant to. Didn’t think too much of it. 

He would ask for pictures of my daughter saying that shes so cute and getting so big and that he couldn’t wait to meet her. 

One day he called me huffing and puffing about how this guy he was supposed to get tattooed from flaked on his appointment. Drew wanted to go to this guys house and fight or whatever. I tried to calm him down. He txted me after thanking me. 

It was friendly up until the point where he sent me pictures of his new tattoo on his chest and his neck. I talked to my bf about it and he thinks that drew likes me.

"Guys who train/use dumbbells or weights, how much do you regularly lift ?","So I’m just curious what the regular weight that most guys lift is. 

I usually stuck to exclusively body weight exercises but since my parents started supporting me getting into better shape, I’ve been expanding on the range of what I try and do. 

My mother, who has never even been in a gym and is overweight, suggested picking up some weights at a local place. 

So I got a pair of 5LBs and a pair of 10LBs. 

Then my dad (who worked out twice a week over 20 years ago) told me that at 18 I should be lifting atleast 40-50 LB and working towards a minimum of 70LB. Per arm. 

To be honest, I’m actually stronger than I expected myself to be and 10LB is feeling not light but I can barely notice the weight and it takes very little to no effort to do anything with them.

How does a guy struggling with his finances explains his situation to a new date?,"I have been lurking for a while and this is something that I keep thinking about when it comes to start a new relationship.  I'm a middle aged man, never married but with a young kid from a previous relationship; I have a good job and I'm working hard to try to get a promotion and improve my professional prospect, but due to very questionable financial decision in the past I am barely surviving.

I'm working really hard to get my finances in order and I'm proud of the fact that I paid of one loan and will take care of two (or possibly three) this year; things are looking up but besides the times I spend with my kid I'm mostly alone because I think I can't afford dating.

My last girlfriend and I broke up because we couldn't talk about money; we were both middle aged parents with young kids, but she thought I was ""cheap"" even though I paid for most of our dates.  We enjoyed our time together and got along well with each other kids, but we were both  struggling financially and had diametrically opposite approach to money management.

After that experience I put even more urgency on getting a good grip on my finances; I cut my expenses even more, cut my 401k contributions to the minimum... but mostly spend my free time at home watching TV or reading.   That was depressing (and I struggled with depression for a long time when I was younger) so I updated my dating profile and starting swiping left and right.

Well, a couple of weeks ago a very attractive middle aged divorcee liked what she saw and contacted me; we had a nice conversation and ended up exchanging numbers.  I called her yesterday and agree on going on a date on Friday and I really need your advice on how to approach this situation if we get serious.

I know I shouldn't left past experiences mess up new ones and I know that if a woman tells me that I'm cheap for whatever reason that's a red flag that can't be ignored.   Also important to mention because I think is relevant is that I'm an immigrant to the USA and in my culture the man always pays for everything and even though I'm very assimilated I feel really ashamed to let a lady pay for half the bill when we go out....which is silly, because even my last ex actually paid for some dates herself.

I feel like I'm rambling and I don't even know if I have good long term prospect with this lady, but for the future: how should I go about regarding my finances and dating?  I honestly don't even know where to start.",0,"How does a guy struggling with his finances explains his situation to a new date?I have been lurking for a while and this is something that I keep thinking about when it comes to start a new relationship.  I'm a middle aged man, never married but with a young kid from a previous relationship; I have a good job and I'm working hard to try to get a promotion and improve my professional prospect, but due to very questionable financial decision in the past I am barely surviving.

I'm working really hard to get my finances in order and I'm proud of the fact that I paid of one loan and will take care of two (or possibly three) this year; things are looking up but besides the times I spend with my kid I'm mostly alone because I think I can't afford dating.

My last girlfriend and I broke up because we couldn't talk about money; we were both middle aged parents with young kids, but she thought I was ""cheap"" even though I paid for most of our dates.  We enjoyed our time together and got along well with each other kids, but we were both  struggling financially and had diametrically opposite approach to money management.

After that experience I put even more urgency on getting a good grip on my finances; I cut my expenses even more, cut my 401k contributions to the minimum... but mostly spend my free time at home watching TV or reading.   That was depressing (and I struggled with depression for a long time when I was younger) so I updated my dating profile and starting swiping left and right.

How to proceed with gym crush,"We’ve been going to the same gym for quite a while, but I’ve only noticed in the last couple of months that he’d stare at me. At first, I thought this was maybe by chance, but then it happened too often so I figured there was more to it.  I did one of those smile nod things to him a few times and he’d keep staring. So naturally, I started paying more attention. He would often look over at me from afar and glance over. If I looked back, he’d look away and that happens quite a bit. When we walk passed each other, he wouldn’t make eye contact. Then, in the last week, I noticed he’d actually put his head down when he’d see me approaching from afar, and turn his head away. I asked him last week if he was using these weights by him, and when he saw me approach, he put his head down and just nodded no without speaking or looking up.  I also feel like he’s on nearby machines often or just generally in the same area, but that could also be coincidence. 

I went back and forth on whether I should even say hi.  It seemed like I made him slightly uncomfortable if he can’t make eye contact. Plus, I certainly don’t feel/look that attractive in the gym. Then today, he was getting spotted by my friend so I thought in the least this could make for good conversation.  He was at the machine next to me at the end of my workout, so I finally got the courage to introduce myself. He was super nice and actually not really shy at all.  We talked about our workout for the day and where we’re from in the area and so forth. He even said he noticed how much I can lift and called me strong (which in the least makes me think he wants me to know he’s looked over?).  I said I hope it wasn’t weird that I came up to him and he said he was glad I did and it wasn’t since we see each other practically every weekday. We talked for like 5 minutes and he was actually the one who kept trying to talk more. We shook hands and said we’d see each other tomorrow. 

So I’m just really bad at reading signs, but it kind of seems like he may be interested as well? I want to see how the conversation goes for this week and if we actually do more than just wave, then maybe I’d ask him by the end of the week if he wants to grab a coffee sometime. Should I wait longer than that? Should I try to gauge how interested he actually is/isn’t since we just spoke for the first time? TIA!

When did you start feeling like a grown-ass adult man?,"So the other day I went to the mall. Looking for a new watch, I entered the jewelry store. When talking to the salesperson there, I felt like I was just a teenager who likes shiny stuff walking in, and wasting the salespeople time, but they were taking me as a serious customer. I ended up buying the watch I was looking for. 

I had the same feeling when I bought my car last year. Walking into the dealership and talking to the salesman there, the feeling of being a teenager walking in just cause I like cars that go vroom vroom came back. 

I have the same feeling when I go to my bank, I do adult shit but I sure as hell do not feel like an adult. I still feel like I’m nothing but a curious 15 year old teenager.

Is he oblivious or just not into me?,"I've (23f) been talking to this guy (22m) for the last month or so. Met at work and he seemed like a cool dude. I asked him out and gave him my number. We went on one date, and he said he wanted to do it again. We've been talking every night since. He's a bit awkward though. He was homeschooled, never had a GF and I'm pretty sure he's a virgin. I'm not. But I don't mind any of that. 

I can't guage if he's too awkward/ oblivious to my advances. I've been lightly flirting with him. But I don't really get anything back. So I don't know if he's not into it. Or, if he's just inexperienced with flirting. He said that he's bad and flirting and often can't tell.

So I guess, what do I do now? Do I come on stronger and maybe make a fool of myself? Or back off and stay as friends (which I'm also happy to do, he's a cool guy, I don't mind either way).

How can I clean up mold after a flood in my basement?," Hey all,

So two weeks ago our basement flooded, luckily the basement is unfinished and nothing of value was damage. Now my main concern was once I cleaned up the water, the flood had white fluffy mold growing as the floor was drying. I had a fan and a dehumidifier running the whole time yet mold still formed. This last weekend I ripped up the large area rug that was now garbage and tried to mop the floor with cleaner thinking that would get rid of the mold.... nope. Once the mop water started to dry new mold started forming, same white fluffy stuff as before. Now my main concern is my pregnant girlfriend (she doesn't go in the basement) and my cats as their litter box is in the basement. How can I clean the cement floor without mold growing? I'm in Canada and opening basement windows is not an option to help air out the basement.

What are some effective ways to reignite passion in my relationship?,"Just a little background. My (24F) boyfriend (23M) and I have been together for a little over two years now and I feel like I am the cause for our lack of passion. After recovering from a very traumatic and abusive divorce on my side, we met one another soon after while I was admittedly still healing. I have a son from my previous marriage and we are currently expecting another seedling together. He has completely and wholeheartedly put himself into and accepted the role of being my sons father (birth father is not involved whatsoever), and he is over the moon excited for our little one brewing. I started going to therapy after my marriage concluded and was eventually diagnosed with depression and anxiety. He was there (in my life) for my diagnosis, me first getting on meds, and me being medicated. He has stuck through it all and has endured me and all my baggage. My issue is this-I was a bitch. I was and am still learning to deal with jealousy, anxiety, insecurity, depression, PTSD, and now that I am pregnant, I’ve had to halt all my previously prescribed meds. I feel like all of this has caused him to harden to me a little and become less...in love with me. I know he loves me and our family, but I just feel like I don’t make his eyes glimmer like I used to, and I do not want to lose him. I am realizing the fault in my ways and I want to be better. I still go to therapy and am still healing. We still have sex regularly, maybe 2-3 times a week, definitely not as much as we used to, but I want the connection we used to share. I get glimmers every once in a while but it doesn’t last. What are some ways that I can whoo him again? Or remind him why we fell in love? Maybe little steps I can take towards growth?

"Have you ever turned someone you liked down, but then ignored them? Why?","2 weeks ago, I wrote a post here about confessing to my close guy friend through a letter along with his Christmas present.

He said he's liked me for awhile, but doesn't want a relationship given our circumstances; I was trying to process what he was saying and grew silent. The phone call ended with me saying goodnight and nothing felt right.

My life-long best friend wants to date me.,"I’ve known my best friend since we were kids, we grew up together, then he moved away but visited every summer vacation. He was the first guy I kissed and dated. First time in 7th grade, it went wrong (he liked a friend of mine and kinda dumped me), then in 10th grade (same thing + he was having drug issues and was all over the place and screamed at me and locked me up in a room).

I stopped talking to him after the 2nd dating attempt, he got sober and 2 years later apologised for being such an asshole until I forgave him and we became friends again.

Then once a year or so he asked for another chance to be with me. I always said “no” because I never wanted to get hurt again + he was always judgemental of who I was dating and was always asking for a new chance only after his relationships were failing. He had this romantic idea that we should be together bc we knew each other since we were in diapers. But it felt like a desperate last resort option. I never felt like a priority.

That happened for years until I introduced him to a colleague of mine, 4-5 years ago, and he basically married her after a couple of months of dating. I made up some excuse and did not go to the wedding - I couldnt believe he was so nice with her and with me he never had been, despite me always being there for him. He got upset and we didnt talk for a year, but then we reconnected again and were best friends again. I even visited him and his wife and I was happy for him. He was an emotional wreck before her, had alcohol problems and then he became like the best version of himself. So I understood her personality brought out the best in him and I was trully happy for him.

He was sometimes rubbing it in my face that he could have married me instead, but apart from this, it all seemed awesome until they had a baby and he told me he was cheating on his wife. He said they were not having sex and this was an arrangement they had made.

At the same time, we spent an evening together watching a movie and all of a sudden I started feeling things for him, which totally freaked me out because I had never had any romantic feelings for years for him.  Plus I was seeing someone else. I basically ran away from his flat in the middle of the night. I told him about my feelings and we decided to just move on.

At the baptism of his kid he was super strange - totally ignored me. We still hanged out whenever he visited (we live in different places).Then he called me to wish me a happy NY - which he never does and told me he got a divorce. I was shocked, he seemed so happy with his wife, only mentioned she is bad with money, but nothing more. 

We hanged out and stayed up late drinking and talking. He told me everything about the marriage. And then - AGAIN, hinted at us being together. Told me he doesnt feel as close as he is to me with nobody else and that he had been separated from his wife, but they had kept it private since she was pregnant (so the night we watched the movie and got close he was not with her anymore).

It got me thinking. Should I give this a chance if we happen to both be single at the same time? I am physically atttracted to him, I love him a lot, what happened happened in our teens, now we are in our thirties. But I still have this feeling that he wants more the idea of me and a romantic dream than who I am. And that no matter how convincing he may sound, I should stay the fuck away. All his relationships ended within 4 years time. They all started and ended the same. And he never wanted to go to therapy or do some soul searching.  Just partied until the next one, then got sober again and so on.Now he is still seeing the girl he cheated on with because she totally adores him and he hates being alone. Which I kinda get but I dont know... it feels selfish. And I dont like the way he treats her. Most of the time he is nice to her, but he sometimes treated her like a servant. Or like she is stupid... not ok. She is also much younger than us.

Just partied until the next one, then got sober again and so on.Now he is still seeing the girl he cheated on with because she totally adores him and he hates being alone. Which I kinda get but I dont know... it feels selfish. And I dont like the way he treats her. Most of the time he is nice to her, but he sometimes treated her like a servant. Or like she is stupid... not ok. She is also much younger than us. 

TL;DR: Should I date my best friend? We’re in our thirties, been friends since we were born, through many ups and down, but I dont feel I can trust him."

How much does your mindset affect your view of yourself?,"Before I start, I'll preface this by saying I understand that it could be considered vein to care about one's appearance, and that I should just 'get over it' or 'stop giving a \*\*\*'. I'm just looking for some input from other men who may have gone through something similar.

**Onto my post...**

Over the past year, I have made inconsistent but effective changes in my life to try and address certain faults within myself. I have made significant progress when looking back at how I was this time last year. 

I've completely overcome a habitual addiction that had been destroying me for the last 2 years. I've grown socially and emotionally, and I've been working on my self image and how I present myself.

I still have a long way to go, but i'm making progress, slowly but surely.

One of the things I seem to be stuck on is my physical appearance. I've been told i'm good looking and had interest from women. But I can't accept it. I have major insecurities with my looks, and they have always affected my confidence. So much that until last year, when i turned 21, I never let myself entertain the idea of having a romantic partner, Instead I convinced myself that I actually didn't desire any romantic relationships. (when in reality, I was just trying to suppress my worries that I'm not good enough to have one).

**Now onto the main point of my post...**

I noticed that some days, when I look in a mirror, I think I look hideous, and my mood is then affected for the rest of the day. But I noticed that when I'm having a good day, have taken care of myself and my responsibilities, when I look at myself, I see myself as a decently attractive guy. My smile looks better, eyes look more lively, hair seems nicer, my figure even looks improved.

Does having a negative mindset really reflect how you see yourself to that extent? Could most of my worries and insecurities be fed by my negativity and self loathing, which in turn actually makes things seem worse than they really are?

I'm just trying to understand how my opinion of myself can vary so much, all depending on what my current mindset is.

If anyone has any similar experiences, or reading material that could help me understand this situation, I'd really appreciate it. Feels like I'm a bit stuck trying to figure this out.

Can you really be platonic friends with someone you slept with and is it ok to hang out with them when you now are with someone else?,"So, I’ve known my boyfriend since August 2018, we’ve dated a few times in the past but this time it’s not casual and we’ve been together for 3 months. When we first met we’d both just gotten out of serious relationships where we’d had our hearts broken. 

He met F around September 2018 and they had a short casual fling and remained friends. I was a little jealous of her (never met her and personally don’t think she’s attractive but he obviously did). So they’ve not been in a relationship and they haven’t (as far as I’m aware) had a sexual encounter for over a year. In that time we dated for a few months but it wasn’t good timing as we both were still messed up from the serious relationships, and then he dated someone else entirely for four months. So I knew he was still friends with F and didn’t care much until we started dating again towards the end of last year. We got back together because it was a better time for us both and the feelings never faded. 

We told each other we love each other, a big deal for us both having only said it in serious relationships before. I brought up F for some reason and he told me he wishes they never had a sexual relationship because they’re really good friends and she helped him through his break up and he values her friendship. Fine, not ideal as I have no experience with guys having female friends they’ve got a history with, but I have to accept it. 

Anyway, I have a history of overthinking and he knows this. He’s always been completely honest about something if I ask him a question, which i really appreciate but I found out from a Facebook post that she tagged him in that he’d been at hers in the last few months. I asked him about it calmly and he said ‘yeah, I was there around November I think?’ And I asked why he hadn’t told me before or if he lied about it and he said ‘I didn’t lie, I just didn’t mention it. It didn’t come up, I don’t tell you every time I hang out with the boys and I didn’t want you to over think’ but that’s really upset me. He said he realises he should have told me (in fairness i think it was before we told each other how we felt and before things became more serious where were now talking about a future together) and that in future he will mention it just so I feel included and know that he’s not being shady or hiding anything. 

I genuinely believe from his point of view that there’s no feelings there, if there was then he’s had the past year to start things up again. However, he told me that she’s made it clear she’s interested in him by asking if we’re still together and when he said yes she’s responded by saying ‘damn’ (this, as far as I know, was after they last hung out, I think she said this recently). 

I mean, in general guys is normal to hang out with a girl you’ve slept with but have no feelings or attraction to, one on one? They hung out at her house and had a takeaway and watched a film. I just can’t wrap my head around this and don’t want to be naive but at the same time I’ve never had a boyfriend who’s had female friends he actually hangs out with like that, and I don’t have guy friends that I hang out with alone regularly if that makes sense. 

I don’t want to make him feel like he can’t be her friend, I don’t want to be controlling or anything. But I’m uncomfortable with them having out again knowing now that she still likes him and quite frankly, I just don’t get it. I don’t see why they would need to meet up and hang out and do what we do minus the sex when he has me?

Can you help me to understand a different perspective please?

Tl;dr: my boyfriend is friends with someone he had a casual sexual fling with over a year ago and they sometimes hang out alone. He assures me they’re just strictly friends (from his side) but I still feel super uncomfortable with it and don’t know what I should do."
What are your experience choosing girlfriend over career?,"Hi,

I was not a good student in my time at the university because self-doubts and procrastination.In the last stages of my studies I got my things together and graduated with no time loss.Now I 'm a PhD and love working and doing more than normal hours mostly because I enjoy being different than my ""student-self"".I would love to do more and after my thesis join a big company to work on my career.

The problem is that my girlfriend and I have different approaches to our careers.She wants a steady job with a lot of freetime for family, me and friends.And I want to focus on my new me with new working ethics.

I dont know if the situation arrises in which I have to decide on a job or her.So is there anyone of you who had to decide in the past and what are your experiences or even regrets?

Kind regards",0,"What are your experience choosing girlfriend over career?Hi,

I’m not sure why I come across feminine/gay,"How to come across more masculine?

I’m wondering if anyone has any tips on becoming more masculine? 
I’ve constantly been mistaken for gay my entire teenage life. I’m almost 19 and have never had a girlfriend. 
I’m not sure what it is about me that makes me seem gay, I guess I subconsciously act in a feminine way. I think I may make quick movements while interacting with people. For example, if I were sitting down somewhere and someone come up next to me and said hello, I would quickly turn my neck to them subconsciously. Is stuff like that a feminine trait? 
I don’t have a gay voice, I’ve always been told it’s deep. I think a contributing factor to my femininity is the fact that I was raised by women primarily, my mother and my grandmother. My father died when I was very young, and thus I didn’t grow up with much of a masculine role model. 

Please suggest some tips on how I can become more masculine? What are some typically feminine mannerisms guys use that make them seem gay?",0,"I’m not sure why I come across feminine/gayHow to come across more masculine?

How does an adult man work through a fear of intimacy? Have any of you overcome this?,"Fear of intimacy, meaning, a fear of being physical vulnerable with someone.

"""Better to have loved and lost than to not love at all"".","It's been probably 6 or 7 years since I've seen this girl in person but to be frank she's always been on my mind in one way or another. We used to text each other all the time and even hangout by ourselves occasionally but I was always too afraid to make a move. I always wonder if it was due to my insecurity and feeling she was completely out of my league but what kills me inside to most is that the more I think about it, the more I think what wasted opportunity I had.

I was into her the minute I met her and even through my insecurity I managed to get her number, visited her house and she visiting mine. We would even talk about sex and fantasize about being together however we would both always chalk it up to joking around. But even through all that I let her slip through the cracks, without even a kiss. I feel I'm the direct example of the Shakespearean adage of ""Better to have loved and lost than to never love at all"", with me obviously being an example of the later.

With typing these thoughts out I can now see clearly that the main point of this post is to remphasize to you young guys out there that if there's any girl that you have that feelings for please FOR YOUR OWN GOOD TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL.

I'm curious what the male thoughts are on the ending of The King on Netflix?,"Although I had my suspicions throughout the plot of the story, I was shocked at the delivery of the reveal. It was empowering (in sense) how clear it had all been to her and how she debunked months worth of poor rationalizing by his part in the matter of a few ending minutes.
But again, it sets the whole stereotype of how women fix things (situationally), born sages but not ingenious enough to be anything more than sidekicks. And how men even at their most powerful are intrinsically egotistical and blood thirsty, failed to doom by their egos without the company of a woman to guide his decisions.

"To all the guys who are outgoing, how can I become more like you?","Hello gentlemen.

I’m 21 and currently living with my parents, fresh out of college. With tons of more time on my hands and single (although my heart does belong to a special someone), I’ve always wanted to be a little more social or outgoing. 

I’ve always been a good kid growing up. No drugs or alcohol, never around the wrong crowd, did his homework and studied and did well in school, but I always seemed to prefer indoors rather than the nightlife or whatever. 

I think I’ve always thought that I’m a good person, but severely lacking in the social department. Yet, I’ve never really been attracted to partying or clubbing or drinking or anything. Even when I’ve been offered the chance to go to any of these things, I refuse. Some people see this as abnormal due to my age, but I’m unsure about that. 

To add a little more personal details, I’ve been to a couple of parties, but they’re not really my thing. I was actually bored, even with a little alcohol in my system. I guess I’m boring? But I don’t want to be like that forever, so how can be more outgoing? Or is there something wrong with me for not liking what most people my age like to do?

Pain after long period of arousal without ejaculating?,"Hi,

I'm a 31 yo gay male, and a few months I started dating this guy I'm really into and super attracted by.  

Recently we spent a 7 day vacation together during which we were in each other's presence all day long.   It was also the first time I went on a relatively long vacation with someone I am dating and liking so much.  We would have sex in the morning then go out and have sex at night again and do fun activities during the day.  

The thing is that, in the period between morning and evening sex, I was constantly excited.  Since we had sex around 9 am and then again around 11 pm, I basically had a boner that would go one and off for 13 hrs (say 30 min on, 30 min off). 

The first day this happened it was quite fun.  I was excited to be so excited, but then I started to feel pain at the basis of the penis, at a +/-45 degree angle in the direction of the abdomen.  It would hurt on touch, diminish when seated, and gradually disappear after ejaculation.

Maybe some of you will get a kicker out of this, but is this normal? Is this what people refer to as blue balls?

I'm a bit worried this might be causes by some prostate provlems, so I thought I could consult the wisdom of the collective and see if anyone had experienced the same, or had any either anecdotal or professional knowledge that could help me.

Am I needy for wanting more interaction (texting),"Backstory: I (26F) have been dating a guy (27M) for about 2 months now. It's kinda long distance, we live an hour apart and only see each other on the weekends/every other weekend. He warned me beforehand that he's not a consistent texter/this has been a problem with his exes. He's made it clear that if I get frustrated by it, let him know. But he'll go 12-18 hrs before responding sometimes and I don't feel comfortable telling him every few days that I need more interaction. I know he's on his phone all the time so a quick ""I'm thinking about you"" would suffice. 

At first, he made a huge effort to interact, it think it was the whole ""chase"" phase. But things moved kinda quickly and now it's pretty much implied we're together (met his whole fam, bought me a toothbrush for his place, his mom loves me, etc.). So now he makes much less of an effort and I'm happy if I get 1 or 2 responses a day. 

Anyway, this weekend I've been incredibly ill, even ended up in the hospital for a brief stay. I've barely heard from him. I know he's concerned for me but only because he sent a breiyf text saying so. The thing is, things are 100% different when were together, he's extremely attentive, loving, interested in me, always caressing, introduced me to this whole friend group and coworkers. No doubt he's interested, but I just don't understand why he leaves me unread for hours upon hours. Am I too needy?

Why don't I cry anymore?,"I'm not sure this is exactly the right place to put this but I see this as a guy thing soo.

I don't think I've cried at all for at least 5 years now maybe more, I genuinely cannot remember the last time I did. I've had some sad moments in the last few years from pets dying to girlfriends leaving, family members being diagnosed with some scary stuff. But none of these ""sad"" moments have made me upset? It's not like I feel ashamed if I did cry or that people would see me as ""not manly"". I just find it really difficult to express the emotion of sadness.

I don't think I've cried at all for at least 5 years now maybe more, I genuinely cannot remember the last time I did. I've had some sad moments in the last few years from pets dying to girlfriends leaving, family members being diagnosed with some scary stuff. But none of these ""sad"" moments have made me upset? It's not like I feel ashamed if I did cry or that people would see me as ""not manly"". I just find it really difficult to express the emotion of sadness.

How to decipher if an online crush is worth pursuing?,"I’m a single parent of a four-year-old daughter. I think I’m ready to get back into the dating world and found someone that has peaked my interest... by the content he posts online.

I’ve been on dating sites such as OK Cupid and plenty of fish and the only person I have hung out with off of one of them are people I actually knew in real life that found me on there and reconnected.

Q4 Black Men: How do you feel with dating white girls? Guilt?,"Im black, I've been with white girls most my life.

A few years ago, to me it was just a result of my upbringing, not being very street meant in mixed environments I would have no issue having a white girl into me but never got anywhere with black women, I'm nerdy and not thuggish. 

Recently, I've been learning more about social pressure and single motherhood with racemixing, and I've been conflicted about my attraction. 

I don't want to come across as a white hating person as if I'm INTENTIONALLY trying to spite whites by seeing their women, I genuinely do care.

How do you curb that post-date anxiety when you're waiting for her to get back to you in regards to another date?,"Hey my guys. I'm really at a loss here as to what to do.

I went on a date on Saturday night, and it went well, she was my type, conversation flowed easy, and we made out heaps. Looking back now I realised I wasn't asked a single question about myself (Don't know if that's a red flag or what). I sent her a ""I made it home safe"" text, and it got left on read.

But anyways, she needed some time to think about if we'd have a second date. So I've left her to it, and I'm just sitting here going crazy. I sort of figured she would have gotten back to me the next day, and I told her I wouldn't contact her until she'd come back to me first. So I don't want to come across as a dick by dropping another message. But I sort of feel ghosted? She's still active on socials etc, but I haven't heard from her :(

I don't know what to do with my brother.,"My brother has been stealing from me and he won't stop despite me telling him multiple times not to. It's nothing big, it's been booze and using my dry herb vape and my weed. But it's been a constant thing over a long while that's built up with tons of other things he does to piss me off. He usually pays me back but he never says sorry. I feel like my privacy has been violated and he doesn't respect me in anyway. I keep having to hide my things, but when I'm not home he'll keep searching my room and taking them. He's of age, earns more money than me but still he persists. 

We still live at home with our parents and they been paying a lot of money for neurological appointments for him due to him having his own mental problems. He's told me weed puts him in a dark place and it undoes the progress that appointments have done for him and he that he doesn't smoke it anymore. Which is a complete lie. I've almost gotten kicked out for the house for having weed, despite it being legal here. So ""tattling"" on him isn't really an option as I feel I would be the one locked out and he wouldn't face any consequences.

Ex ignored my apology,"Ok, so I DMed an ex of long ago to ask for old band pictures (he was in a band with friends of mine). We made small talk some, and I sent an inappropriate (sexual)message. I was having bad mental health problems at the time and am married. I felt so horrible about this. He said he wasn't interested as he was in a relationahip.  I sent another message apologizing. He ignored it, so I sent another message. He asked me to stop messaging him. I had originally wanted to collaborate on this project with him, and messaged him about it. No answer. I messaged again, no answer. I messaged again, and he said he wasn't interested.

A month later I accidentally messaged him on Insta as his name on my DM list was above a friend's and I accidentally clicked on it. I messaged him and asked him to delete our conversation. No answer. So I messaged directions as he is not too tech savvy. No answer. I finally got annoyed and said that I knew he was ignoring me and probably thought I was a piece of hot garbage but could he please delete our conversation. He wrote back and said he deleted it and that he was blocking me necause I had no understanding of boundaries or personal space.

Around this time I was hospitalized and got a stern lecture from my doctor to start taking the correct dosage of my antidepressant (I had started taking less to save money as I didn't have insurance at the time). Not being on the right dosage made me act irrational, obsessive and inappropriate.

However, I have noticed that since 5-6 months, I've been growing super lazy and comfortable with who I am.

How do I stop feeling overwhelmed about everything all the time?,"I'm feeling so anxious at the time of writing this. I just get this feeling of anxiety get overwhelmed and this loneliness feeling a lot. I study in at uni in England, but I'm still home in my country because uni starts in a week from now, so I'm still in my country. That means I haven't properly worked out in over a month. And I really miss actually lifting weights and not just doing push ups in my room or small dumbbell exercises. I'm really insecure about a lot of things. My height, me feeling small, how I appear to others, what first impression do I give to others etc. This Christmas period has been super stressful, I haven't been able to feel Christmas because of all of the assignments that I had. I was studying on Christmas Eve, on New Year's Eve, on New Year's day.. From Web Programming (HTML CSS PHP SQL) to Object Oriented Programming to 2000 word essays. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not all, I'm the kind of person who helps everyone.. I had to redo some of these assignments twice to help my friends because they aren't so good at programming and always kept calling me to help them and of course I did, sometimes at the expense of my time. But I don't really care about that because I love helping my friends. It just gets really exhausting after a while. I can't seem to be able to take a break from things. My dating life has been quite shit. I've been on two dates since I broke up with my ex. The first girl ghosted me. Second girl we weren't really compatible which is fine. I keep thinking of how I broke up with my ex and the very next day she blocked me off Facebook so she could add that she was in a relationship with some other dude since May... (broke up with her late August) Was probably cheating for longer though and that just feels horrible.. I moved on though, it's just that I sometimes remember this and ask myself how could she have done that... I haven't had any luck finding any internships or placements so far.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've been to so many interview's and I've received so many coding tests from companies to complete. Worst of all are ""video interviews"" where basically a question pops in your screen and you have 3 minutes to record your reply.. just so companies don't spent time to actually interview someone, but this seems so unatural and I get sooo stressed and I just can't do anything. This week I had this coding challenge from this company to create a whole fully functional working ANDROID APP (had to learn everything by myself) which gets data from a json file, through a phpmyadmin database through a php file in a week. The same week I had to write 2000 word essay, and had friends/coursemates who would call me to hang in a cafe so I could help them start their own essay. I managed to do everything, at the expense of me feeling overwhelmed. I can't seem to find any luck with any girl as well, and this bothers me so much in all honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

 I hate getting ghosted, texting someone for some time, asking them out and they just always can't. I feel since girls have so many guys to choose from, they just go for the best, and obviously I am not the best, I'm not some 6'5 super jacked dude. Same goes for companies, they will hire the best person out of everyone, the one who knows more things than just what is taught in uni. And that's not all, I've even tried to compete, through the past 2 summers I created a videogame myself to make atleast some kind of ""project"" to show that I have work outside of uni... I started playing League again but that game stresses me also sooo much. Life is hard.. I'm really sorry, I feel sorry. I wish my life was more comfortable, I wish I had a job to have some sort of income myself.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents provide me with everything they can, at the cost of them having a comfortable lifeas well, by paying for my studies, my food, everything.. and I don't like that feeling, I wanna give something back. I know you'll say that's what parents should do, and while I agree, I just wish I could help the situation a little bit too you know? One of my 2020 goals was to start a youtube channel to just improve with my insecurities and fears and become more confident in myself.. sucks being 5'6 at 136lbs (although workout).. oh about working out.. I've been doing it for so long yet I think I haven't reached the goals that I aspire to have.. yes I do get some people telling me ohh you work out etc, but I feel weak and small in comparison to others.. Sorry for the rant...",0,"How do I stop feeling overwhelmed about everything all the time?I'm feeling so anxious at the time of writing this. I just get this feeling of anxiety get overwhelmed and this loneliness feeling a lot. I study in at uni in England, but I'm still home in my country because uni starts in a week from now, so I'm still in my country. That means I haven't properly worked out in over a month. And I really miss actually lifting weights and not just doing push ups in my room or small dumbbell exercises. I'm really insecure about a lot of things. My height, me feeling small, how I appear to others, what first impression do I give to others etc. This Christmas period has been super stressful, I haven't been able to feel Christmas because of all of the assignments that I had. I was studying on Christmas Eve, on New Year's Eve, on New Year's day.. From Web Programming (HTML CSS PHP SQL) to Object Oriented Programming to 2000 word essays. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not all, I'm the kind of person who helps everyone.. I had to redo some of these assignments twice to help my friends because they aren't so good at programming and always kept calling me to help them and of course I did, sometimes at the expense of my time. But I don't really care about that because I love helping my friends. It just gets really exhausting after a while. I can't seem to be able to take a break from things. My dating life has been quite shit. I've been on two dates since I broke up with my ex. The first girl ghosted me. Second girl we weren't really compatible which is fine. I keep thinking of how I broke up with my ex and the very next day she blocked me off Facebook so she could add that she was in a relationship with some other dude since May... (broke up with her late August) Was probably cheating for longer though and that just feels horrible.. I moved on though, it's just that I sometimes remember this and ask myself how could she have done that... I haven't had any luck finding any internships or placements so far.

So I'm curious as to how much one means over the other with some.

So what about you, would you give up one for the other? And if so, why?

I'm no stranger to saying goodbye to people I know I will never see or hear anything from again, and I've never stayed in one place long enough to form an intimate relationship with anybody. With that being said, I see it very difficult for me to commit to a relationship in the near future. In the first place, the only thing that mattered to me growing up was going to school and coming home to help take care of my two younger sisters, do chores (laundry, dishes, cutting grass, etc.) and I never owned a car until just three years ago and have never been insured automotive or medical, and this year I have worked at my job to the point where I will finally afford auto insurance in the next month. I still live with my dad, his girlfriend, and her 17 and 15-year-old daughters in a house we moved into four months ago, but I pay the utilities while he pays for remodeling the house. A lot of things in my life have prevented me from forming a stable relationship with anyone I cared about or was interested in, and this year I want to change that. I'm currently writing a book that I plan to have edited by mid-February so in between my job, my book, and my home situation, I've not had many opportunities to get to know anybody intimately. I've tried Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, Hily, POF, even Taimi, but what's the point of using any of those apps if you've never had a friend take a photo of you before? I've gone out to a couple of night clubs by myself plenty of times but no matter how much I dance or drink, I can't help but feel empty by the end of the night. So I want to know, just to socially motivate myself in what to strive for the next time I go out to make (more like an attempt to make) a friend or even something more, I want to know one thing; what does it feel/taste like to kiss or to be kissed?

How do you deal with the sexual side effects of mood stabilizing drugs such as Zoloft or seroquel?,"I’m 26 years old and I used to have a very healthy sex drive. Around 22-23 years old I finally took responsibility for my shitty maniac behavior and got diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder with a a sprinkle of insomnia. Over the last 3.5 ish years I’ve lost most of my desire to have sex, to the point where I feel almost repulsed by sex. I’m embarrassed to go on dates or bring anyone home because 9/10 times I’m pushing rope. 

I’ve tried replacing the meds but this combo works really well. I have energy, I sleep like a baby, I don’t have mania or suicidal thoughts but I feels like a traded one shit thing for another shit thing. 

It cost me my relationship with my ex because our sex life was amazing and then it went to nothing. My own insecurities lead to fights which lead to the break up. It’s 100% on me and I don’t hold a grudge over it. It doesn’t make it suck any less though. 

I can watch all my favorite porn and nothing, nude photos, think about great fantasies or sexual memories and nothing. 

I’m in the prime of my life and I feel totally cut off from a fundamental human experience. 

What’s there to say or do gents?",0,"How do you deal with the sexual side effects of mood stabilizing drugs such as Zoloft or seroquel?I’m 26 years old and I used to have a very healthy sex drive. Around 22-23 years old I finally took responsibility for my shitty maniac behavior and got diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder with a a sprinkle of insomnia. Over the last 3.5 ish years I’ve lost most of my desire to have sex, to the point where I feel almost repulsed by sex. I’m embarrassed to go on dates or bring anyone home because 9/10 times I’m pushing rope. 

I’ve tried replacing the meds but this combo works really well. I have energy, I sleep like a baby, I don’t have mania or suicidal thoughts but I feels like a traded one shit thing for another shit thing. 

It cost me my relationship with my ex because our sex life was amazing and then it went to nothing. My own insecurities lead to fights which lead to the break up. It’s 100% on me and I don’t hold a grudge over it. It doesn’t make it suck any less though.

Unsure of What to do,"So a good friend of mine had one of her friends add me on snap, because we were (19M(me), 19F) both looking for a relationship. We've been talking for almost 2 months now.

What is the best way to tell my husband I want to have sex with women?,"Hi, men of Reddit! I created an account specifically to ask this question.

My husband is awesome, and I absolutely adore him. We’re very much in love, and our sex life is rockin’.

That said, my husband’s in his thirties and I’m in my twenties, and I have a ravenous sexual appetite for women that I want to continue exploring while I’m still young and sexy. I’m a petite woman with very big natural tits, and women have always been so much better at handling my breasts and helping me achieve climax through tit-play. My husband’s great in bed, but I find myself constantly fantasizing about having another woman suck on my nipples and massage my clit.

So, all of that said, I want to talk to my husband about inviting women into our sex life. However, he’s a little bit territorial in the sense that he doesn’t like to “share” me, regardless of what gender we’re discussing. Therefore, I guess I’m looking for some advice about how to best approach the conversation? In other words, how would you want to be approached by your partner about something like this? How should I express that I love our sex life, but I miss the variety involved with eating pussy and having women press their tits up against mine?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :)",0,"What is the best way to tell my husband I want to have sex with women?Hi, men of Reddit! I created an account specifically to ask this question.

How do you know if you should stop pursuing a girl?,"So here's my situation: I've known this girl for about three years now, we are together in a band, but outside of that we never actually spent time alone together untill recently. I've had a crush on her for a while now, but didn't want to make a move, because she didn't seem to be interested in me. But a couple weeks ago we were kinda forced to hang out by chance for a couple of hours and it was really great, we were talking about a lot of different things and laughed at each other a lot and all that stuff. So i decided i should ask her out for a coffee or something, i did, she said yes, we hung out, it was really cool. I didn't make any moves, we just had a fun time. Then we started texting, it seemed ok at first, but then it turned really onesided, me sending stuff and her responding (although the responses seemed enthusiastic, they didn't lead the convo anywhere). Our schedules are really packed and most of the week we are in different cities, so i asked her out for coffee again the next week, she said yes. It was cool again, we were both really tired after a long day, but it was still fun. Knowing that we are in the same city the next day i suggested that she called me if she had any time. She did not. But ok, that didn't matter to me much. I saw a movie playing that day in the cinema in town and asked her if she had time, she said she was busy and nothing else. I then suggested another date when the movie was playing next week and she said yes. We had a little bit of contact during the week through texts, but it was still mostly one sided. So the day comes, she was working a bit late and came to the caffe about half an hour before the movie started, so we didn't have that much time to talk before the movie but it was still nice. Then after the movie she just said she needs to go, so it ended really weirdly. She was feeling a bit under the weather though, so it was kinda understandable. And she sent me a text saying she is sorry when she came home. The next day when ended up still texting a little bit, but then the convo died out again. I really like this girl, but i am really confused if she likes me back or not, it's really hard to tell.

I (22F) think my shy male flatmate likes me but not sure.," Long story short, I (22F) moved into a house with two guys (let’s call them Person A and Person B) who are childhood best friends. Both of them are in their mid-to-late 20s. Person A is a lot more outspoken than Person B, and Person B, in my opinion, is a bit more shy around me cause he always fidgets and walks around everywhere whenever I speak to him alone. 

There are various reasons why I keep getting a gut feeling that he likes me: 

* he’s always curious on where I’m going in the evenings/weekends, and who with 
* he’s relatively protective about me (e.g. when I was really drunk at my birthday he wasn’t the nicest to my guy friends who were taking care of me when he came to pick me up to bring me home)
* whenever we’re in a group setting, he would always find the opportunity to flirt with me (e.g. making jokes about stuff I’ve done, and tease me for stupid things). If not, he would always speak to them about me. 
* I’ve caught him look at me a few times and noticed that he glances at me all the time whenever I’m looking at something else
* he remembers the small things about me (remembering that I like sticky toffee pudding, etc) 
* he’s never spoken to me about relationships/dates/girls. 
* whenever my friends try and flirt with him he would always look straight at me even when it comes to answering their questions. 
* whenever I speak to him there's always a prolonged eye contact that I can't seem to pinpoint on. 
* he always laughs at whatever I do, and he also blushes whenever I speak to him.
* before Christmas he told me he got presents for people he cared a lot about. And on Christmas I found out that he actually got me and Person A each an individually wrapped present. The present itself is a bag with an image of two bunnies kissing. 

But there are also reasons why I think he’s not into me: 

* he would come back home and go straight to his room 
* he prefers to hang out with our other Person A alone rather than alone with me. 
* he sometimes looks quite uncomfortable/bothered when I speak to him which I don't know if it's just him being moody. 

I just need some advice about this because I also think he is quite cute. Personally I don’t really want to make a move but I just want to know without asking him if he actually feels something for me. My friend spoke to him on my birthday party when he came to pick me up and apparently he was telling her how cute I was that night - plus she also said that she picked up a vibe from him that he has something for me. I’ve told my friends about this and most of them have said either there’s ‘something there’ or he has a ‘soft spot’ for me. Thoughts?

Should I marry her?,"I love this girl, but I’m not sure. We’re both 35 and in a long distance relationship so I am feeling a little pressure to make up my mind. Since this is a serious question this won’t be short, but I am at a loss and would appreciate any advice.

About a year ago I lost my job. I’m born in the states but have Croatian roots with tons of family there, so I decided no better time to see family then when you don’t have to book a return ticket. So I did. 

Along the way I met a Croatian girl who seemed absolutely amazing.... She was sweet, she had a successful business, she spoke my language and seemed to share common values. I had a 6-figure job in the states and I live in the south where it’s common for women to date men for their financial support so they could be stay at home wives, so the fact that we would go to dinner and this girl would pay for our bill while I was in the restroom made a huge impression. Plus she cooks, cleans, washes clothes, irons, gets me presents but perhaps the most defining aspect of this relationship to me is: We’ve never been in an argument despite how BRUTALLY honest I am... Because I was a traveler, I moved in with her 3 weeks in to the relationship. Got a job, stayed for 6 months and every day was so pleasant because it was Croatian beaches, and NO arguing or relationship stress! 

The only issue is the sexual chemistry is not on par with other girls I’ve dated. I’ve never liked the way she kissed from the first moment and I don’t really ever “lust” for her. I’m a healthy male and she is an attractive 5’4 blonde so we have regular sex 2-4 times a week along with a great social life. We travel, go out, she is supportive etc. and while I check out other girls all the time, our sex is not bad and the ease and regularity that I get it keeps me from straying. Also, I love and respect her and I wouldn’t cheat on her....

Now living in Croatia for 9 months I explained that the economy and opportunities don’t compare. I explained that if I and we wanted to have a life and future and provide the best for children in the future it would not be in Croatia... So 10 months later I moved back trying to start a franchise with my savings in order to support her. We now live 7 times zones away and the plan is for her to find a way to sell her business while I ramp up and then she comes here, but I’m getting cold feet.

She doesn’t know too much English (I’m sure she’ll learn) but I brought her for a tour in the summer and she loved it. Honestly she’d make a perfect mother and a great match for me. I lean towards the skeptic/negative side and she so positive, supportive and caring. She’s great with kids and she knows my culture/language/religion and we don’t argue (I’ve tried). She is cute but I always wanted 5’8 brunette and she’s a 5’4 blonde whose kiss doesn’t turn me on...

She has her own successful business in Croatia and all her family is there so it’s asking a lot for her to leave it... and I don’t want to do that to her if things did not go well in our marriage... I mean talk about messing both of our lives up!! I also don’t know how to communicate my hesitations... so I wonder if there are other guys that have been through something similar that can share their own experience/advice?",0,"Should I marry her?I love this girl, but I’m not sure.

I had a 6-figure job in the states and I live in the south where it’s common for women to date men for their financial support so they could be stay at home wives, so the fact that we would go to dinner and this girl would pay for our bill while I was in the restroom made a huge impression. Plus she cooks, cleans, washes clothes, irons, gets me presents but perhaps the most defining aspect of this relationship to me is: We’ve never been in an argument despite how BRUTALLY honest I am... Because I was a traveler, I moved in with her 3 weeks in to the relationship. Got a job, stayed for 6 months and every day was so pleasant because it was Croatian beaches, and NO arguing or relationship stress! 

The only issue is the sexual chemistry is not on par with other girls I’ve dated. I’ve never liked the way she kissed from the first moment and I don’t really ever “lust” for her. I’m a healthy male and she is an attractive 5’4 blonde so we have regular sex 2-4 times a week along with a great social life. We travel, go out, she is supportive etc. and while I check out other girls all the time, our sex is not bad and the ease and regularity that I get it keeps me from straying. Also, I love and respect her and I wouldn’t cheat on her....

Now living in Croatia for 9 months I explained that the economy and opportunities don’t compare. I explained that if I and we wanted to have a life and future and provide the best for children in the future it would not be in Croatia... So 10 months later I moved back trying to start a franchise with my savings in order to support her. We now live 7 times zones away and the plan is for her to find a way to sell her business while I ramp up and then she comes here, but I’m getting cold feet.

She doesn’t know too much English (I’m sure she’ll learn) but I brought her for a tour in the summer and she loved it. Honestly she’d make a perfect mother and a great match for me. I lean towards the skeptic/negative side and she so positive, supportive and caring. She’s great with kids and she knows my culture/language/religion and we don’t argue (I’ve tried). She is cute but I always wanted 5’8 brunette and she’s a 5’4 blonde whose kiss doesn’t turn me on...

She has her own successful business in Croatia and all her family is there so it’s asking a lot for her to leave it... and I don’t want to do that to her if things did not go well in our marriage... I mean talk about messing both of our lives up!! I also don’t know how to communicate my hesitations... so I wonder if there are other guys that have been through something similar that can share their own experience/advice?"
Fellow males why is my perspective on women different and dating became harder?,"Yeah a somewhat misleading double title.
But what I simply want to ask is have you ever experienced a change in your perspective on your taste for future partners and dating game after a relationship with a women whom you really loved but who dumped you? 

In my case it's that now being in my mid twenties I don't care about just having a good looking GF or FWB thing anymore but instead I want someone who has more attributes like a solid income, maybe experience with living on their own, finished university, is loyal and rather a positive person, has no past traumas to project on me and the list goes on. I'm back in dating and it's just so hard to find someone in their 20s who ticks a few points off this list. Sometimes I think going to clubs, bars and stuff isn't the right place to start with. Also tinder and other dating apps became quite shallow. I 2014 and 2018 both times where I freshly came out of a relationship I didn't have to use such things since women where either hitting on me or showed obvious interest. I think I have to learn to approach and find the right spots to meet people.

I just don't understand why I'm not interested in casual stuff anymore and my perspective has changed so much. Is that something that comes with age and experience?

My GF is weighing me down with her suicidal thoughts and aggression.,"Hear me out. When we first started dating, up until now (which has been a year and 5 months) shes always been so aggressive by nature and a disrespectful person when shes mad. She always wants her way and is not accommodating to my pov in any arguments. She always “gets what im saying” but then she continues to push her way across. And if i get even the slightest of upset or angry she gets suicidal thoughts because she doesnt feel loved, even though her mental health has been taking the biggest toll on me. Its hard knowing she hurts herself because “ i dont know how to solve problems” or that “you never do things right”  i dont know what to do, this is my first love and relationship and i really wish this would work out but it seems like it doesnt. This whole relationship feels like toxic fights, an overwhelming amount of sacrifices. She wants me to behave like a b and c, but she doesnt. I dont know if i want to leave her because i wNt shit to work out, and i dont wamt her killing herself if i leave which could be a possibility. Mentally im so fucking drained i cant take this bullshit anymore. She gies to counselling but never lives up to the principles they teach her to make her better . And personally ive bene her councillor for a long while and she doesnt do the shit i say either to change. And our fights last a lifetime, she drags our fights on for weeks...

What do girls want most on the first date!?,"To be at ease and smile. 

In my experience, if you can make a girl smile and laugh a lot you have a better chance of having a smooth first date and also a better chance of seeing them again. 

Smiling and laughing brings about a sense of ease and comfort and first dates can be tense at times, so ease that tension by keeping light playful energy with them. 

I have found that the most effective jokes are at your own expense, so the girl has a 'free' chance to laugh :) 

After all, girls just wanna have fun!

For some reason she was explaining everything to me like if i were some sort of retarded kid(at least that was what i understood by the way she was speaking to me) and she told me that for next time (next day i think) she told that she was going to bring her ipad and proceeded to explain to me what it was, at the time i felt pretty offended by it and she noticed so tried to apologize for it. I don't remember if it was the same day or the day after that a manage to stop studying together without telling here that was partially because of what she told me.

"Men who regularly approach women, what's the story of your most memorable failed attempts?","Here's mine.

Some time ago, I was out shopping with my cousins and decided to leave them to look around because they were taking too long. I head over to a nearby coffee shop and spot a really hot girl seating alone.

Now in my experience, seeing a hot girl, especially one thats alone is incredibly rare, so I thought to myself, ""damn this is my chance, don't fuck it up!"" (I fucked it up). So I did a quick fix of my hair, rolled up my sleeves and confidently walked towards her.

As I was walking towards she notices me and puts up her guard, and as soon as I say ""Hi"" she blurts out, in the bitchiest way you can imagine.

""Ugh, I have a boyfriend.""

Now I've experienced it enough times that girls can lie about that, and to some of them its just a test. I was prepared for this.... or so I thought....

I was sweating,

I could feel the fear creeping in my whole body..

and by the sound of her tone, it felt threatening

My mind went blank and so I just blurted out whatever my mind first thought...

So in a fearing, unmanly way...

I said,

""Oh, me too..""

I quickly realized what I said, but the damage was done. She facepalmed, like a disappointed couch when their NBA basketball team does a rookie mistake and lose the game, she facepalms and laughs in disbelief of how bad things went.

I could do nothing but laugh at my own embarrassment as I walk out the coffee shop, only to embarrass myself further by going back in because I forgot to order my coffee, trying to go about my day like nothing happened.

Anyway, thats my most memorable failed attempt. At least now both the girl and I have a great ""me too"" story to tell.",0,"Men who regularly approach women, what's the story of your most memorable failed attempts?Here's mine.

How to grow into being my own man?,"**TL;DR:** I'm a young adult with daddy issues who really needs advice or some perspective on being more content in masculinity and growing into my gay, non-gender-conforming self, past validating myself with others' opinions.

Hey, AskMen, I'm a young guy who really has had trouble expressing myself being a guy and stuff. I've tried to dismiss it as gender not meaning much to me, but like other times I've lied to myself, this denial is hurting my life and emotional stability.

Generally, I've been considered an emotional and ""feminine"" male, which while not completely incorrect has caused me bullying over the years that has eroded security in my own presentation of being a male. I've been trying to strengthen my identity, but with no prominent positive male role models in my life, I feel lost. Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is the closest thing to a caring dad I have.

Thing is, I feel horrible even saying I want a male role model. I've always wanted to be an individual with my own identity separate from race, gender, sexuality, etc., but I'm realizing those are parts of myself that I connect with. I want to be accepted along with my identit***ies***, not despite them.

All this confusion has gotten to the point where I have sent other guys nudes of myself, just for validation that I'm attractive or worthy in some way (not forcefully mind you, I'd hate myself even more for that). I know that sounds crazy, but the validation from other guys that I'm ""guy-enough"" for them was pleasurable past the sexual aspect. I guess that's ""daddy"" issues for ya.

Also, because I don't have any not-stereotypically-masculine male role models, I'm not even sure how to style my afroamerican hair that I'm trying to grow out that will hopefully help me tackle some parts of my own identity.

All of this probably comes from my family who--as an example of their character--asked me ***twice***, **fearfully**, if I was ***\*gasp\**** **gay**, while I asked for therapy for my depressive symptoms arising from my past, family situation, and identity troubles (not that I told them all that or even that I'm gay).

So, yeah, I'm not sure what I'm doing with myself as a man. I want to be male, but I'm not sure how to live a happy life that way. I have some surprisingly supportive friends for a rural, Christian town, but I'm still scared, hesitant, unsure, etc. Typical feelings for post-teen pre-adults, I'm sure, but it's all the more real nonetheless. Any advice and anecdotes are appreciated\~

Would like advice.,"I work with a girl. She shows a lot of interest in me. Found out she has a fiancé. She never talks about him.

I don't want to be a homewrecker so I try to just be nice but I have to admit I flirt a little bit and appreciate the attention.  


At work she did something small for me and said something along the lines of 'if I have to do this (insert thing that would take 5 seconds to do) again you owe me a coffee' so I had to have her do it again and she stared at me looking serious about her 'offer' and I didn't know what to do so I just brushed it off laughing awkwardly. I don't want to help her cheat, but idk the best way to tell her how I feel, especially in a work setting where we have almost no private time to talk. I also don't know if I should even consider going somewhere with her (I'll probably have to drive us, she has no car right now) and Im not even sure if they live together, or if its okay to even get coffee with someone who is engaged at all since, personally I have always decided to never do anything even remotely close to cheating when I was in a relationship.  


Honestly I feel dumb about not knowing the perfect course of action in this situation. I should know better but really don't know the protocol.

How To Get Over Being Stood Up?,"Hey everyone, these past couples of days have been a whirlwind of emotions.

So I entered my second semester of college a few weeks ago and went out of my to talk to women(I never dated beforehand). Many times, these women wouldn't show the same interest back and it never went anywhere. However, I met this one girl from my Chem lecture and we quickly bonded over the past two weeks. 

I finally pulled the trigger last Friday and asked her out to lunch after our Chem lecture. I was super nervous, but she agreed! I can't tell you how happy I was when she said yes. All of my guy freinds made a big deal about it and congratulated me (I know, it's cringe but it was my first date haha)

I texted her yesterday afternoon asking when she was available for Tuesday. She didn't reply back all day yesterday, even though she was snapchatting, and finally sent a response this morning. She basically said she wasn't into me and didn't see us more than freinds. She said she only said yes in the heat of the moment to not make it awkward.

Of course, I feel awful, but how can I get over this? My confidence(which was already low) is at an all time low. I hated myself these past two months and have been heavily insecure( short- 5'7, higher pitched voice and small hands). And now they all seem to be validated",0,"How To Get Over Being Stood Up?Hey everyone, these past couples of days have been a whirlwind of emotions.

Would it help if I quit porn?,"Hey everyone! I tried posting this a few times, I had to change the title. I tried to ask, ""Have you ever quit porn? If so, I'm looking for some advice"".

I've been watching porn since I was a kid, and never really thought about quitting until I started looking into nofap and all that. I was wondering if anybody who quit could answer my question here.

I've been in a relationship for five years now, and I hope to marry my girlfriend one day, she's perfect. My problem is that I've noticed that I always have urges to have those awesome threesomes and have this super wild sex with 12/10 women like you see in porn. This is the only reason I am thinking about quitting. My sex life is great, but I can't help but think about stuff like that A LOT. It's almost always on my mind.

So my question is, did you find that those unrealistic urges went away? I want to get rid of them completely.

TLDR: M20 thinking about abandoning relationship to try other things.  
  

Well, I am 20-year-old male and often I am unintentionally d\*ck person. I mean, I have girlfriend, we met in summer and it was the most awesome summer ever for both of us. We went camping several times and etc. Then we started university, my girlfriend had random sadness and anger issues and she always said things that made me so upset, that I had to turn my phone off to not think about that.... Well, once I went at my university course (it was like 3 day stay at school, sports, dance and etc.) and I just had to turn off my phone again... I was so upset and went to have dance with my friends (it was better than sitting somewhere alone and sad.) I am not party guy but if I do party with my friends, I can do all the crazy dances and etc… and then I ended up on slow dance with girl (there was nothing wrong with it, we were just chatting and got dancing together just by accident... BUT there was a spark between us, like huge spark and we actually spend rest of the night smiling at each other and talking (but still, just as friends, no flirting and anything like that), it was nice but I was sure I want to stay with my gf.... But that spark never left me (and never left her)... She knows I am in relationship and when I tried to turn her down, she said she really likes who I am, my personality and she is going to wait. She is the kindest person I know and even thou she is not the sharpest one ( but honestly, I am also not the sharpest too), she is super hard working (I can brain out lot of things without much effort, but she can learn anything she wants (she has a strong will))  
   
 

3 Months later, me and my gf had really hard time understanding each other, we broke up and I just started to talk to THAT girl again and bought her flower just to make her happy (there was no date but it was still d\*ck move in my mind). Well one month after breakup my exgf wrote me, we started chatting and I decided I want to try that relationship again, because of that awesome summer. We are still together, I doesn’t work perfectly, especially while we are chatting (I am quite a busy person, I have my work as IT specialist and also I do tech help, web development, develop my own arduino solutions and repair/build laptops/PCs, graphics stuff and etc. so chatting is must and we were together for ""only"" about 20 hours a week). 

 And now I am here, we are arguing a lot while chatting but most of time when we are together, everything is fine and we are quite happy together. I think our personalities are ""incompatible"" in long run, and after one pregnancy scare, I realized I am not sure if she is my person for life (I would never leave her if she would be pregnant), but I don´t want to break up with her (actually half of me wants to break up because I am not sure if she is the correct person for me (she is crazily unproductive, stubborn, often lazy, don´t like to study but also loving and intelligent person)).

I think the only reason I've stayed so long is fear I won't find someone else, fear of going back to my parents after being independent for so long and not knowing how to pick my life back up, and not knowing got to pick up women down the line as I've been in this  on and off since high school

I have aspersions in life, but one of them has always been a family, and j just don't know how to end this, or where to go from here as I've never had any kind of time role model to teach me these things....

How do you guys do butt hygiene? Serious,I'm being serious but using poop vocab. I have a hairy butt and when I go #2 I push it through this hairy forest. Sometimes its soft so it's like wiping peanut butter out of my hair. I wipe until there is nothing on the TP but I can't help feel unclean. Do men trim or shave their butt hair? Do you scrub it in the shower? Do you use a washcloth or just a bar of soap? How often do you wash it? I showered with 100 guys in the military and nobody ever washed their ass so it doesn't seem like a thing but I feel like just wiping with TP isn't enough. Thanks.,0,How do you guys do butt hygiene?

What should my fifteen-minute morning exercise routine be?,"I have about fifteen minutes I can spend in the morning to exercise. I have five and ten pound weights, a pull-up bar attached to a door frame, and a yoga mat. I don't really want to spend money on anything else.

Twists: 

I can't do push-ups, due to an injury that screwed up my shoulders. I've not really noticed other issues except for when I'm doing butterflies or similar movements. (My sister's an occupational therapist and she thinks I screwed up the cartilage or joint in that direction.)

I do have an extra minute on each side, since I use a Quip toothbrush and I could do something while I brush my teeth.

(Please don't suggest that I expand these parameters. I know you're well-intentioned, but I also know that if I try to work out any later than right after I wake up, I end up not doing it.

How should I handle my situation with women?,"I’m what society would consider a good-looking 32-year-old white guy. I have plenty of experience with women in my teenage years and in my 20s. However, I lived at home with my parents, and basically didn’t have “real world” responsibilities. Due to the harsh realities of life, my family is gone, and I’m on my own as a fully financially independent man. With that said, I’m barely getting by in life. The money I have goes to bills and basic necessities. I’m trying to pursue a long-term difficult career venture in film &amp; tv production. 

Women always position themselves around me whenever I’m in public and I can’t help but think “You may be attracted to me physically but you won’t stick around if you knew my situation.” And because of that, for the most part, I don’t approach women who give all the cues. 

My problem: I’m so bothered by the fact that I feel this “invisible peer pressure” to talk to girls when I don’t feel comfortable with my life situation to wanna pursue them.

Do testicles have taste receptors?,"So recently, I’ve been seeing videos on tik tok of guys dipping their balls in soy sauce or sugar water, because supposedly testicles have have taste receptors. The tik toks have lots of mixed answers, some say they taste it, some don’t. 

So of course (without doing any research about this) I HAD to try it for myself. I just cut a plastic cup in half and filled about a quarter of it with soy sauce. I plopped my balls right in annnnnnd...nothing. I let my boys sit for about another 30 seconds; and still nothing. 

Thus, concluding my experiment. If any of you guys have tried it, did you taste anything? And if you haven’t tried it, try it.

I also have a brother and my father and I don’t think they poop that much. Is that a normal thing ? I don’t want to be dramatic and tell him to go to the doctor but I really wish he would. That’s so bizarre to me. Sometimes he goes even more than 5 times. I am sorry that this a gross question but I need to know if I’m being a ignorant girl or is this actually not normal at all.,0,How often do most guys poop in a day?Hi this is a serious question.

What are some ideas of pictures or videos I can take to send to the wife?,"We took some time apart and are getting heated for each other. We're only 30 years old. So we are sort of discovering which kinks we might be into. Role play stuff and stuff. 

But when we're apart weve been taking pictures and sexting and I'm out of ideas of what I could do to send to her. The only thing I can think of is dick pics and masturbation. While she is super creative and sexy and could probably be in all kind of positions that are super dope I keep coming to a blank on what I could do in return other than masturbation and a simple dick pic. 

Any ideas on how to be more creative? Nothing is going near my butt, just a disclaimer.

At what age did you think of being committed to a serious relationship?,"A year recently, I have seen a guy quite often. We used to study the same university at undergraduate level some 10 years ago, graduating and working in different cities for some years after graduation. We actually did not talk much back at university, just kind of knowing there was such a guy or a girl in the school. Several years later, we happened to pursue graduate school abroad at the same country. He actually started 1 year earlier than me. As we have more time here meeting each other and we don't have many friends here, we are getting closer. We go to the supermarket, department stores, cook, go to the exhibition. We have a lot of things to talk and quite comfortable with asking each other out for a meeting. It is just frustrating that things seem to be just like this and can't get further though I think my signalling is quite clear but then I somehow can read from conversations that he still enjoys single life and has no intention of being in a relationship. As a girl, my ideal relationship is to have it start as friends and we somehow know each other well and are comfortable around each other. I am more like seeking for a right one and make the time right. And we have seen each other like more than 20 times this year and I can say that it is not really kind of close friends' hangouts.

If I have feelings for a man friend who doesn’t like me back, but he is super flirtatious.. it can feel weird flirting back because i have this feeling of guilt that I’m making him uncomfortable or might cross a barrier. . I don’t feel like i know the dos and donts of this situations..

ALSO

If there is a guy friend who has feelings  but I don’t .... but flirt occasionally anyways. . What kind of response are you supposed to give? Bluntly rejecting the flirty stuff feels mean..especially if it’s just borderline being nice (compliments), laughing it off might mislead, and flirting back seems even more misleading..

So we matched on a dating sight and had been texting back and forth a lot but it was over the holidays and I was away visiting my family so we hadn’t physically met up. Things got heated we started sexting. But out conversation were great and sweet every morning I’d wake up to a text from him and go to bed with one. Sooo after a couple weeks we finally meet up and it was wild. Soo much sex and kissing 5 times in one night.

How do I get over the formality hump in pursuing a relationship?,"The title might be a bit confusing, but the question I have is this. I don't have any problem talking to anyone once a conversation is started. As long as I have stuff to add to the conversation, talking is not a problem. The problem is I don't know how to veer things towards a more intimate tone. Not only that but I'm scared to even try, especially with people that I only kinda know or just met. 

In other words, when it comes to conversing with people about anything I don't have a problem, but the moment I think I want to pursue something with someone I hit a massive wall, and just have no idea where to start or what to say. 

I suppose some background, I'm 21 going to university, and my last and only relationship was at the end of freshman year of high school.

do men find tears/crying very alarming?,"So I've always been an emotional woman since I was a child (my parents didn't have the greatest relationship) and I'm the type of person to internalize my stress in order to not let it interfere with my work. I tend to cry and listen to music as a way of releasing my stress and negative emotions, because I feel infinitely better afterwards (I suppose it's like a coping mechanism). it's similar to how some people watch sad or dramatic movies (e.g. the notebook or me before you) to release &amp; forget about stress. 

my bf of about 9 months (and 3 years as a friend) is concerned about my crying habits. he thinks that I am depressed and he is also worried that he's a bad boyfriend that can't stop his gf from crying. I have told him countless times that I'm not crying because of him nor am I depressed, but rather it's a way for me to release stress (just like how he plays video games and takes naps). I've also told him that for me, I need to cry before facing stressful situations because then I can release my negative emotions and gain a clearer, more logical attitude towards the problem at hand. Also, I have been crying less lately because I've been finding other active ways to release my stress such as reading, yoga, and going out with my close girl friends.

but he still thinks that I am depressed &amp; that he is a bad boyfriend. of course, his concern is understandable and I appreciate the fact that he cares. but I want him to understand that my tears are not an indicator of sadness or depression, but rather a way for me to relieve my stress and emotions at the end of a tough day.

I apologize in advance if I make this too much about my biased experiences. 

I’m a 20 year old runway and lingerie model living in New York. I’ve been fully immersed in the adult world since I was 16 and have heard a lot of tales about marriages that break up due to lack of sex, or how sexual attraction is the foundation of any romantic relationship. 

When I turned 18 I started escorting through my agency to supplement my income and saw first hand all that men ( and some women) would put on the line ( thousands of dollars a night, their careers and reputations) to get some sex. 

I’ve slept with many individuals and couples who have immense power but would make themselves vulnerable for sex. These are people who are known to be cruel and hardened but they would become sweet during sex. 

I’ve fallen for a lot of my clients, in particular a couple that say that they’d do anything for me. I spend all my time giving them the most mind blowing sex, making all their wild fantasies come true. And they’d even tell me they loved me and say they would give up their empire for some mind blowing sex.

But when I was in a really desperate emotional situation, even when I still gave great sex they would change the subject when I looked for support. When I ask for them to listen, they might do so for a few seconds but then they want the clothes to come off again. Yet they can hold me like I’m their ultimate valentine after they orgasm and say they love me.

I realize they don’t love me. Yet the absence of the sex I give them causes men and women to leave long marriages. It just doesn’t make sense. I’ve seen men and women share the most intimate acts with me and then when they think I’m out of earshot they talk about me like I’m just another person they happened to know. 

I don’t know why they would call sex making love anymore. Love is such a valuable thing yet people treat sex like the most important and most trivial thing ever.",0,"Why is sex an essential part of love, an expression of it, yet sex alone can’t get you love?

How to deal with a dude in our workout group that is constantly talking shit about me?,"so i workout with a group of people. this one dude is 6’2, 330lbs. to be brutally honest, he is fat and out of shape. yet he swears to god he is “super swole”, the “strongest in the gym”, he’s a “absolute unit” (he says all that stuff). im 5’8, 160lbs, around 12% body fat. him and i almost lift the same weight. He lifts like 10-15lbs more than me. he “can lift heavier but isn’t feeling it today” (his own words). 

he always makes subtle comments about me being “little” and “weak”. like today one of the guys in the group was squatting just over 500lbs and the dude i’m talking about goes “our whole group could probably squat that, well except [my name] he’s just too small and weak for that”. yet he squats the same weight as me. he will try to talk to a girl at the gym by pointing at me and saying “yeah you probably lift more than him”. Like we could be talking about lifting and out of no where he will throw my name in there and try to shit on me even though it was completely irrelevant to the conversation. 

i got on the scale and it was 161lbs, and he goes “dude you are so small. how are you only 160”. one of the other guys was like “dude, do you only work out with him so you can shit on him and feel better about yourself?”. 

at first i would just laugh it off and just put it aside as him joking around. But this is every day now and it’s just getting old.

"Why is long distance worth it, when is it the right time?","I already asked a question over on r/LongDistance, but I came here to see what you guys think.

TLDR: I just got into a new LDR with my girlfriend under the impression that our end date was sometime within a year. Over the phone, she told me that she was thinking about staying out of state for another 4 years. I want her to do whatever she wants and whatever makes her happy, but I don't know if I have it in me to do an LDR for 4 years.

Long Explanation: I am about 5 days into a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend of about 2 weeks. Now that I am saying that out loud it sounds kinda crazy, but let me explain.

I recently ended things with my ex-girlfriend (we will call her Mary \[19F\]), we had been talking for about 5-6 months and had been officially dating for about 2-3 months. We ended up breaking up because I realized I had just kind of fallen out of love with her, I was no longer happy with the relationship. Around that same time, my ex-ex girlfriend (we will call her Jane \[18F\]) just got back in town for Thanksgiving break from college. We ended up hanging out and the first night we just caught up. But then Jane and I were basically talking throughout the whole entire day and we ended up hanging out almost every night during the break (abt 7 days until she went back). Over the course of the rest of the semester, we facetimed/texted all of the time, and when she got back from Winter break we of course continued to spend a ton of time together.

Jane (explained): Jane is my ex-girlfriend (turned new girlfriend) that I dated for 6 months back in my senior year of high school, she was a junior at the time. Jane was my first real girlfriend that I truly loved and cared about and it was an amazing 6 months. But things started to change during the end of it and I could feel myself slipping out of the relationship. I ended up cheating on Jane with another girl (not sex though) and that was what ended our relationship. I honestly felt so horrible about it and mad at myself (I was also drunk when it happened), that I told Jill that I really felt like we should spend some time apart. I decided on this because for a while we tried to make it work, but she couldn't hang out with me without feeling like shit. So, in the end, we broke up.

Fast forward to this last semester, when I started dating Mary. She was amazing, and the first couple months were awesome. But then with a combination of things, I started to fall out of the relationship with Mary. We ended up breaking up around Thanksgiving break, where Jane comes back into the picture.

When Jane and I first started dating again, it was about 2 weeks ago and I was under the impression that she was going to come back to our home state within a semester to at most a year. We were talking a couple of days ago and she brought up the fact that she is thinking about doing 4 years of school out of state. As much as I love her, I just don't know if I have the capacity to do an LDR for another 4 years. Hell, I am only 5 days in and I miss her so much, it is probably one of the hardest things that I have ever had to do. So I brought up my thoughts and how I was feeling with her, and she thought that I was being selfish. Her reasoning was that I tell her all the time about how I would do anything for her, but that I wouldn't be able to do an LDR with her for longer than a semester. I told her I am open to the idea of a longer LDR, but that I just wasn't expecting it at the time. Luckily she is only a 6.5-hour drive away from me, but our schedules work out where we would only be able to see each other 1-2 times a month and I would be the one driving to the other person the majority of the time (she doesn't have a car). She asked me why can't we just take it one step at a time? I told her I think it would be a good idea to have an end date in mind.

How can I overcome the fear of being a lone wolf? (19m),"Although I’m an adult there are times where I hate being alone. I live in a pretty rough city and there are times where I ask my little brother to go places with me so I’m not a target. This is because our city can always have a shooting or a robbery at just about any time of day. I don’t think I have any enemies but I do know that I am always cautious. It honestly gets to the point to where I feel like a beta male. I do not participate in anything illegal or in gangs.  This instance also follows me to college at a stronger level since I go to school in a different  city. 

I don’t have an issue with being out alone. I think the bigger issue is always feeling like someone around me intends to try and rob or even kill me.

The Thing that surprises me is that this issue never even occurs to me when I’m with a girl.

I can't tell if he likes me," I've started this math class at my college that I go to once a week. I was late my first day so the only seat available was next to this cute guy. During that class we like joked around, but it was nothing that really caught my attention. So when it finished I walked out and got in my car to go home. Once I got on the freeway home I was in the fast lane behind a car that was driving slow. Mind you, it is 8 pm and there aren't many cars on the road right now. So I move over to try and pass, but as I speed up, the other car speeds up and won't let me pass. Of course i'm annoyed so I look over and see the guy from my class looking over and like laughing at me. We are both going the same way, he lives 20 from my house. So we like ""raced"" and he drove right next to me until I had to take my exit. So as next week comes along, I was joking around and told him he was driving so slow, and he was like ""I was slowing down because I thought it was funny."" During that class we both tease each other quite a bit, but like I'm so bad at knowing if he's really into me. He's a little shy with me but he like shows off and is more outspoken to the other guy in my group. I wish he would just ask for my snapchat or literally make a move. That class, he pulled up next to me on the freeway again and it was funny like the first time. I've never had any guy do that before, it's wild. SO is he into me or do guys just do that?

Everything was perfect until last night. We were  in my car and she was acting a little off and and said to me “ Have you ever gotten a cold sore? I have the cold sore virus, hsv1, but I most likely have it genitally. I had symptoms 3 years ago that swabbed negative but the doctors said they were fairly sure it was herpetic.

What do you do when a girl cancels a date last minute?,"So had a great first date with a girl earlier this week. We kissed goodnight and made plans for last night.

I agreed and then she even asked how my day was, which I was surprised at. I asked her what she wants to do for Tuesday and she suggested she cooks us dinner then we watch a movie.

I was pretty bummed because I was looking forward to the date and last minute cancelled dates in the past for me haven't had a great track record for a makeup date.

How do I save myself?,"At 18 I suffered a life-threatening injury that rendered me unable to attend college.  Suffering an ""Anoxic Brain Injury and Cardiac Arrest"", my confidence, self-esteem, mood and many other aspects of life I worked so hard to build seemingly plummeted after this single event.  I spent a long time solely recovering from my injury with the one goal of returning to school.  I'm currently 24, back in college and there are many aspects of my life I could complain about but I really just want to feel capable again.

That was what I felt at the core of my being prior to my injury.  A semi-sold foundation that was built upon my experiences with friends, girls, PE class, swimming, socializing and other things.  When I woke up, I was ready to face this life we all live in.  I knew not everything would go my way or even as planned but that's how it was.

Since I woke up from my comatose state and been conscious, I don't feel like a man or even that I'm growing/improving.  Rather I feel like a boy.  I've retracted into my shell/shy-nature that I broke out of in high school and I don't know what to reverse this.  I'm timid, quiet and scared.  Somewhere along the way I rediscovered my love for anime and video games and can literally shut myself in my room for the next decade.

What I'm asking is how do I save myself from a life of mediocrity or maybe even less than that with where I'm headed?  I'm currently travelling and visiting my father.  I live with my single mother, 2 brothers and am an uncle to one of my brother's two children.  I've spoken with my father and he describes that I am yet to cut my umbilical cord to my mother.  I love my mother to death but believe his vague statement is wrong as many things happened after my injury which resulted in me living a quite solitary and boring lifestyle.

I feel week and don't know what to do with myself in this life.  I've felt like this many times before but ended up retracting into myself.

I've retracted into my shell/shy-nature that I broke out of in high school and I don't know what to reverse this.  I'm timid, quiet and scared.  Somewhere along the way I rediscovered my love for anime and video games and can literally shut myself in my room for the next decade.

What I'm asking is how do I save myself from a life of mediocrity or maybe even less than that with where I'm headed?  I'm currently travelling and visiting my father.  I live with my single mother, 2 brothers and am an uncle to one of my brother's two children.  I've spoken with my father and he describes that I am yet to cut my umbilical cord to my mother.  I love my mother to death but believe his vague statement is wrong as many things happened after my injury which resulted in me living a quite solitary and boring lifestyle.

I feel week and don't know what to do with myself in this life.  I've felt like this many times before but ended up retracting into myself.  Men of Reddit, how do you suggest I save myself and turn my life around?"

Have I ruled out any possibility of a relationship if I hooked up with a guy at a party?,"Context : I [26F] had some drinks and went home with a guy [31M] I met that night. Just about 1 month before, I got out of a relationship of 1,5 yrs, and I also had a mild crush on the bartender who invited me to the said party. I let this new guy know about these aspects. 

One week later we met again at the same venue, but this time at some fair we were both participating in, I was selling my artworks and he was there as an event photographer. While I was there he took me aside and said that he had a really nice time with me, and he does not usually act like this, not saying anything, but he was sick, and anxious, and he kew he'll see me again at this event, blabla, I didn't take him seriously. I said okay. 

We then talked about spending NYE at the same location, and so we did. We hooked up again after that night. And a few times after. 

Once I tried to ask him to get out for a drink, but he said he didn't want to get out and then invited me to his place for a drink. So I just tought okay, it's clearly just a casual relationship. 

Another evening we were chatting online and my phone was flooded with notifications as he liked almost every photo of mine on Instagram.

We haven't set any clear boundaries of what kind of relationship this is. I am not very invested emotionally as I actually don't really know him, but I like the kind of guy he is, and the sex is really great. He didn't seem to mind cuddling afterwards either.

I keep thinking of him a lot, and I feel like I would like to know him better but I'm scared it's too soon and I might ruin the dynamics if I open up this subject.

TL;DR: I hooked up with a guy I never met before at a party and now I feel like I ruined a good bf material by going home with him.

"Late-bloomers or virgins, how do you handle conversations about sex in your friends group?","First of all, I think this might have been asked before but the searches I made retrived me nothing.

I'm 27 and for reasons that mainly concern to my mental health (mostly anxiety, self-image issues) I'm a virgin. Sometimes I'm with my friends and they start to talk about sex, not in a bragging way, but mostly sharing and discussing opinions about it. This makes me insanely depressed. I believe they know I never had it, so I think they don't push me to talk about it, but still it's really bad to stand there and not participating and no really knowing what t do.  
In one hand I don't think they should stop talking about it just because of me, it would be selfish of me to ask them to do so and since it's not done in a harmful way, I don't think they do it in a harmful way.

How to make lasting male friendships in your late twenties,"TLDR: 28 male who has struggled to make lasting friendships seeks advice on how to make and hold friendships, and what exactly you should expect from a good male to male friendship 

I’m 28 and am in a bit of a social rut.

I’ve been sick for about two years, and while I have made some friends during that time, I’ve had a hard time extending those friendships beyond the contexts that I meet them in.

I do have one good mate, but he lives far away and we only catch up about twice a month, sometimes it can be a couple of months before we see each other. I have another good friend from childhood, but he lives in a different city so we don’t speak much. We play phone tag a lot. 

I have a girlfriend who is great, but I need more male friends. I’m not socially bereft, but I am lonely sometimes and would like to make some more meaningful friendships with guys my own age.

I tried mini war gaming through a local hobby store and met some guys through that. Some are cool, some are just weird. It’s hit and miss when I bump into them because the store isn’t near where I live. I’ve been thinking about potentially trying another store as well just for variety - but truthfully I’m just nowhere near as into it as they are. And they don’t seem to have a lot of interests beyond it really. They’ll be sitting there geeking out about rules and stats, but I’m mostly interested in painting them. And I’m a slow painter and don’t spend as much on the hobby as they do. 

I want to get back into BJJ or maybe Muay Thai, but I’m to broke to afford that and a gym membership right now. The gym membership is cheaper, but the customer base there is older and I haven’t met anyone through there. I’ve also gained about 40kg from 2 years of quite bad physical health. While I am working out regulalry (3-5 a week depending), I’m struggling to regulate calories and that’s why I’m not losing weight. 

I am still in university. 6 years in to a three year degree (thanks, undiagnosed ADHD). I have made friends in different courses before, but they tend to fizzle our after the course is over. I make an effort to extend the friendships outside by organising times to get lunch, but it’s always me who does the organising I’ve found. None of them have lasted more than six months or so.

In all honesty, it’s so much easier to meet and sleep with women than it is to make friendships with men. That’s been my experience anyway. Maybe it’s just the kind of personality I have. 

I think as well I can inadvertently be too keen. ADHD does make you enthusiastic and curious, and sometimes I think I can be a bit much. I think I can make people feel like they’re being interviewed. I don’t mean to do it, I just don’t know how else I’m supposed to go about figuring them out. An older friend with ADHD has told me that often people with adhd just move to quickly for others, I guess that may be what happens.

I’m not socially retarded anymore. I definitely was when I was younger, but I can be quite popular in my work circles (depending on the place I worked at). The place I work at now is populated by older people who are dull. I’m interviewing for another role now, so hopefully that’ll put me back around other people my age.

I’ve always struggled to make an maintain friendships though. I’m really good at meeting people, just not at extending the friendships. I don’t really get invited to parties anymore (I don’t know anyone who hosts them to be fair). I used to really be into weed and ecstasy. I don’t do either anymore because they make me more anxious than I like to be. Sometimes it can be hard to find people who I relate to because of that - they just aren’t that interesting to me. And then the ones who dp drugs who I find interesting make me anxious because I don’t like to do drugs anymore. It’s tricky. 

I also just plain struggle to trust people. My best friend from high school turned out to be a massive narcissist and fucked with my head a lot. Another friend of mine who was older manipulated me and fucked with my head - to the point where there were times I feared for my safety. I understand not everyone is bad, but my radar for bad people may be a bit over zealous. 

Friendships with women are more what I’ve had. Emotional turn taking, lots of talking and back and forth. More just hanging out. As I got older I realised that in most cases, I was actually wanting to sleep with that girl and not being honest about it. Now I do have the good friendships with women, but they’re sexual relAtionships 90% of the time. I am currently in a monogamous relationship.

I’m bringing that up because...well I don’t really understand how to have ongoing friendships with men. It seems to be about activities. It’s not just about hanging out and talking shit. Drugs seem to be a big factor (even if we’re just talking about booze). 

The guys who I am closer friends with are super open. They are the ones who I have long talks with and who I just hang out and eat a good meal with. I don’t find many dudes who are like that though. Maybe I need to look for a different kind of friendship with men?

This is a ramble. I just wanted to write something out. My question is how do you go about turning acquaintances into friends, and how do you then turn those friendships into deeper friendships?",0,"How to make lasting male friendships in your late twentiesTLDR: 28 male who has struggled to make lasting friendships seeks advice on how to make and hold friendships, and what exactly you should expect from a good male to male friendship

Friendships with women are more what I’ve had. Emotional turn taking, lots of talking and back and forth. More just hanging out. As I got older I realised that in most cases, I was actually wanting to sleep with that girl and not being honest about it. Now I do have the good friendships with women, but they’re sexual relAtionships 90% of the time. I am currently in a monogamous relationship.

I’m bringing that up because...well I don’t really understand how to have ongoing friendships with men. It seems to be about activities. It’s not just about hanging out and talking shit. Drugs seem to be a big factor (even if we’re just talking about booze). 

The guys who I am closer friends with are super open. They are the ones who I have long talks with and who I just hang out and eat a good meal with. I don’t find many dudes who are like that though. Maybe I need to look for a different kind of friendship with men?

This is a ramble. I just wanted to write something out. My question is how do you go about turning acquaintances into friends, and how do you then turn those friendships into deeper friendships?"

When to have the DTR talk?,"I'm 23 and he is 38,

I'm Capricorn and he is Taurus (according to the zodiac we have high compatibility),

I invited to a bar nearby my work, and we had a few drinks, we had such a great night, we ended up doing Molly and going to the park around 1am where he sang songs for me and we lay down looking the stars, we spent 2 nights together in a row.

I noticed he is very affectionate and warm, he kisses me, he holds my hand, hugs me, he is caring and smart, we only text to plan our dates besides that he doesn't text to catch up (I guess he is not a great texter), he is kinda mysterious, I don't know and I can't tell what does he is looking for I know the only way to find out is to ask him but I am very shy, introverted, insecure and I am scared to be rejected, I noticed he still uses his dating profile (even updated it with a new picture), I have the feeling he goes on dates with other girls and I  feel it's too soon to have the DTR talk (it has been 3 weeks since our first date), I am getting to know him more and I just don't want to crash, I need to find out what does he is looking for without scare him.

Should I wait? Should I let him take the first move? Should I look for the signs? Should I speak up about my feelings? I don't know what to do without sounding desperate ( I tend to fall in love very easy)

How do I stop thinking female interaction is them showing romantic interest in me?,"I'm not really sure how to approach this but I'll try to explain my perspective. I started a new internship last week and it's a big change from my previous experience, much larger group, more diverse, highly competitive, and a lot more interaction with female coworkers. Today I go in a bit earlier than usual and start working, around 9 the rest of the interns show up except for one, this chick shows up a bit late and sits next to me since no other seats are available.

Throughout the day she starts asking me a bunch of work-related questions, occasionally she does this thing where she looks in my direction says something softly as if she's expecting a response but she's not, and she does this weird thing where she looks at me as if she wants to say something but she doesn't say anything. I don't think this is anything, but while I was thinking about the ""signals"" I realized I do this a lot with the females I interact with where I interpret a regular conversation as flirting or some sort of interest in me.

Later in the day me and my brother were just hanging out and talking shit and this came up in conversation and he jokingly compared me to Joe from the Netflix show [You](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211991), I thought it was funny but I also think there was some truth in what he said, the tendency to over examine social interactions is unhealthy.

Men who had a decent/good/great relationship with their dad. What story do you want to tell about them?,"I dont remember how old i was but i was young.  My dad had an open water kayak.

"Men that are married or in a LTR, what is a funny/ weird/ awkward experience happened to you as a result of living with a woman long term, that would never happen to a single man, or male roommates?","I’ve been with my wife for nearly 15 years now, and one thing that constantly gives me a new “WTH?” moment is the places I find her hair. SWMBO has long (mid back length) very fine blonde hair. I’ve found her hair woven into the seam stitching of my work truck which she has never driven, and only ridden in a handful of times. I’ve gotten them wound between my toes because they’ve gotten into my socks and over the work day tied themselves around my toes. I’ve pulled them out of every piece of clothing I own at one point or another. I’ve even had one wrap itself around a tooth like a piece of floss somehow. Pulled them out of the dogs (both ends) and the cat. 
But today, a new and surprising hair discovery happened. About halfway through my day, I started to feel a strange and mildly uncomfortable sensation around my boys, plums, wedding tackle, nuts, balls, testicles, or whatever refer to them as. When I first noticed it, it just felt strange. So I manually adjusted, and the tightening feeling got stronger. At that point I just reached into my boxers to try and locate the cause of my “discomfort”. 

Turns out a couple of my wife’s sheddings had knotted into a literal clove hitch (ok, it might have been a bowline or anchor hitch, I was more concerned with removing the offending hairs than examining the knot work) around my sac that was tightening itself as I moved.

SWMBO has long (mid back length) very fine blonde hair. I’ve found her hair woven into the seam stitching of my work truck which she has never driven, and only ridden in a handful of times. I’ve gotten them wound between my toes because they’ve gotten into my socks and over the work day tied themselves around my toes. I’ve pulled them out of every piece of clothing I own at one point or another. I’ve even had one wrap itself around a tooth like a piece of floss somehow. Pulled them out of the dogs (both ends) and the cat. 
But today, a new and surprising hair discovery happened. About halfway through my day, I started to feel a strange and mildly uncomfortable sensation around my boys, plums, wedding tackle, nuts, balls, testicles, or whatever refer to them as. When I first noticed it, it just felt strange. So I manually adjusted, and the tightening feeling got stronger. At that point I just reached into my boxers to try and locate the cause of my “discomfort”.

Does a woman being able to cook make her more attractive?,"My father ( he would have been 73 this past october) told me that a woman being able to cook a good meal made her a ""good woman"" or more likely to be noticed by men.

Advice on mental health,"I don't know where to post this. I posted something similar on [r/selfhelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/) but didn't get any responses, so I hope this is the right place.

So this is something I can't quite get over. The mainstay advice if you're unattractive is to basically get in shape and become physically fit. I've been going to the gym for 2 years, have made okay progress but honestly am not where I should be. Because I'm not at my potential looks-wise, I feel worthless about who I currently am. I don't want to be happy until I've reached my full potential and this is causing a lot of anguish. When I look at gym transformation pictures, I don't feel motivated to change myself. Instead I feel bitter and resentful about how much better my life would be if I looked good and feel pity for my current meek self. There is no logic to these feelings. Of course it would be better to be strong and have muscles than to not, but to me this is synonymous with the paradigm that until I've reached that goal, I basically suck and am worthless. I just can't stand the thought of people in the future liking me because I've reached (lets face it) an evolutionary standard of male attractiveness, whereas before that I was a loser worth no ones time.

Has anybody else dealt with this? I want to change for the better, but I also don't want the journey to be painful. I could really use an eye opener right now, or some book recommendations/general advice.

Found a paper towel with brown crusty stuff. Is there a reasonable explanation for a private time pleasure moment to look like this?,"Long story short, my husband (24) has previously cheated, so I am extra observant. I know about self pleasure, I find the paper towel all the time (all clear crusty, sometimes slight yellow tint) 

I found a recent piece (I know it was found within 1-6 hours of the deed). The paper towel I found was with the crusty stuff (I know what it is). This time it had a brown tint in places. It looks as if it was wiped across skin to get the rest of it. It looks like what it looks like if there is slightly dried /old blood from a woman, mixed with the pleasure fluids. Am I making enough sense? 

Anyway, men, is there a reasonable explanation for this other than an extra marital relation? 

Please enlighten me, even if it’s the worst possible thought running through my head. 

Do I ask him about it? If it’s a normal think that happens sometimes, I feel it’s humiliating to show him, but if that’s not likely, maybe I grow a pair and ask him what’s up?

Tips on how to improve self-image/self-confidence,"This is probably a common question but wanted to ask anyways.

I (20yr M) have started to be called out by some close friends for not loving myself and think that I have no choice but to address it. 

Despite being told that I’m a decent looking guy at worst, I’ve had issues with confidence and body image for years. My first girlfriend made comments about my...anatomy that left me shamed, and since that point I have been scared to be intimate with anyone else. Discovering porn around that same time didn’t help and made me even more scared bc of the stereotype around black guys, which i don’t fit into. On top of this, I was bullied most of schooling until I started to play sports in high school. Even after the tide started turning on how others saw me, I have never been able to get the hurtful comments of that girlfriend and all the a-hole kids in primary school out of my head, and it still affects me to this day.

I already work out pretty regularly, am funny, and generally personable. Outside of my physical appearance, I am happy with myself and confident. But I can’t bring myself to like who I see in the mirror, and can’t even take a compliment.

"When can a girl act ""too much like a guy?""","My male to female friend ratio is about 3 to 1. I've always gotten along more with boys (and men, for that matter) than women and girls. I always chalked it up to the fact I have more in common with ""stereotypical boy"" things: Cars, Video Games (I have an entire collection of consoles and games), Porn, Money... etc. In translation I just levitated towards these things growing up and currently. Make up and nails don't interest me either, I only wear makeup for special occasions and such. I'm also significantly less emotional than most women that even my therapist picked up on it and so have my male friends, and I think logically and often have the level head in the group when everyone else is panicking or arguing. 

However, I'm also starting to wonder if these traits are also my downfall. 

Now, I'm not about rant about anything I really just want some male advice because I'm not a guy, but I have noticed that although all of my male friends have easily became my friend and latched on to me I started learning that they initially had crushes on me. It makes sense, but then as I talk to them and started asking why they never said anything I get the weirdest answers. One of my friends said that they thought they didn't have a chance and I'd be angry at them, another said that I didn't look interested in really anybody, therefore he would be wasting his breath, another said that I was more like a legitimate homie than an opportunity to date the more we got to know each other, and one said he friendzoned himself because ""we got along so well that he realized that he would have no one to argue with"" (This one got me). Other answers I've gotten are the typical ones, too scared, thought I'd stop being friends with them, etc. 

My 3 closest male friends, the ones I hang out with one on one, take me to dinner, get me gifts, tell me about their personal lives and I actually show affection to, that everyone said I should've dated, I haven't dated because of specific reasons: One is gay [18M] and I helped him figure out he was gay, One I've known since we were in the 4th grade [20M] and we're not each others type, and One is 7 years my senior [27M] and we know it would be short term because we have different goals. However I explained to them my issue I'm running into and they all said that there isn't anything wrong with me (literally, the [27M] said I was just too young). However the [18M] said I might be coming off more as a homie than a potential girlfriend and I should start acting more feminine. I thought he was crazy. I don't dress like a guy, and I clearly look like a female. Plus I was wondering if his version of female was the stereotype which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. 

I've also had a boyfriend, but I was acting completely different than I actually was so he would be be satisfied. Once I started showing who I truly was, from the fact I didn't want kids or settle down, cutting my hair, and my major was Economics- he was repulsed. We didn't last long after that, even though we dated for 4 years. I didn't know what was wrong with him, and I thought he just wanted someone submissive... but as I look around... it seems like these guys are kind of intimidated at me or I give off a wrong vibe. Am I really not feminine enough?

I also don't go out of my way to show interest, it's just not my style, I really just perfer you tell me if you are and I'll tell you how I feel and if it'll work or not. I'm not about to make a scene about it or anything... a proposal, sure... just asking me out on a date, no...

Is there any advice on this? I mean I don't plan on changing who I am for male attention at all, and I am only 19 so I have decades to actually find someone who actually fits me. I'm just wondering if being ""too much like a guy"" can be an issue.",0,"When can a girl act ""too much like a guy?""My male to female friend ratio is about 3 to 1. I've always gotten along more with boys (and men, for that matter) than women and girls. I always chalked it up to the fact I have more in common with ""stereotypical boy"" things: Cars, Video Games (I have an entire collection of consoles and games), Porn, Money... etc. In translation I just levitated towards these things growing up and currently. Make up and nails don't interest me either, I only wear makeup for special occasions and such. I'm also significantly less emotional than most women that even my therapist picked up on it and so have my male friends, and I think logically and often have the level head in the group when everyone else is panicking or arguing. 

However, I'm also starting to wonder if these traits are also my downfall. 

Now, I'm not about rant about anything I really just want some male advice because I'm not a guy, but I have noticed that although all of my male friends have easily became my friend and latched on to me I started learning that they initially had crushes on me. It makes sense, but then as I talk to them and started asking why they never said anything I get the weirdest answers. One of my friends said that they thought they didn't have a chance and I'd be angry at them, another said that I didn't look interested in really anybody, therefore he would be wasting his breath, another said that I was more like a legitimate homie than an opportunity to date the more we got to know each other, and one said he friendzoned himself because ""we got along so well that he realized that he would have no one to argue with"" (This one got me).

[SERIOUS] Trans FtM looking for help / advice,"I've marked this as NSFW as it's quite forward. 
I really hope this post isn't out of place, but let me know if it is and I'll remove it. 

Hi guys, I had my very first meeting at the hospital today, just to get some information about the whole transition process from start to finish. I was quite happy with all the info, and how the process will unfold, however my heart dropped a bit when I was told that the avarage penis size (for one constructed) is between 3-10 CM, essentially a micro penis. I wish to have a sex life as normal as possible, but I'm having a hard time imagening it, because I'm scared ill have a 3cm long one, which I'm afraid won't get very far with, so to speak.

Is there anyone here who's been in a simular situation, or anyone with a micro penis who can help me get a different perspective or come to terms with it?

I'd really appreciate some help.",0,"[SERIOUS] Trans FtM looking for help / adviceI've marked this as NSFW as it's quite forward.

REALLY interested in what men have to say about this! please contribute ♡

scenario I: you and your domestic lady partner (gf, wife, w/e) share equal responsibility financially and domestically. you are supposed to do chore A daily (i.e. scoop ur cat’s litter box, your partner is allergic), and both partners are expected to clean up after themselves. you’ve consistently forgotten to do chore A, not because you don’t care and are lazy, only because you have a poor memory. so, nearly every other day your lady partner notices chore A hasn’t been done, and asks you to do it. in your ideal reality, how does she ask you? (answering: “she doesn’t.” is valid, if the bother is in being asked in the first place, i’m also interested in knowing that.) 

&gt; scenario Ib: everyday your lady partner asks you to put your dishes in the kitchen, clean up your spills / messes, pick up your socks, throw away your wrappers, cans, etc. you are expected, just as she is, to maintain a clean environment in the basic ways people do. you don’t keep up on your part, and throw your garbage on the ground, leave dishes to mold, knock things over and not pick them up, tear apart a cupboard searching for something and don’t put the things back or close the door, dirty laundry everywhere, etc. the two of you have discussed a tiring number of times the expectation, the importance, etc. you’re trying, you really are, for her at least, but you just fundamentally are messy. she doesn’t want to remind you, she doesn’t want to ask an adult man to clean up after himself, but she must, or it won’t happen. in your ideal reality, how does she ask you? (“she doesn’t.” is still a valid answer.)

in both scenarios you’re being repeatedly asked to do something you’re expected to do anyway. is that nagging? is there a way to remind or ask that you’d prefer? is it different when it’s your father or male room mate?

I know many women from all different backgrounds who wear wigs for different reasons, and a lot of them are open about it. Does it affect your attraction towards said woman?

I’m just curious if his attraction would deter. Many of my friends, girlfriends, boyfriends who were black - they didn’t mind. They saw it like an extension to beauty; similar to makeup, I guess.

I've tried talking to some other girls since and it just doesn't feel right and all I think about is her. We're still on good terms and she will respond and stuff if I reach out to her. My question is, is how do I start to give her the idea that I want to try again and show her that I finally have changed for the better without just saying it straight up. I love this girl so much, mostly because she was the one that made me want to change who I was, to be the best I could be, and that's when I realized oh crap I can't lose her like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
Is it weird using wigs to change hairstyles as a man? i can't decide if i should go for it or not.,"I dont know if i should post this here but here it goes.

I love having long hair, i find it quite fun and i have gorgeous hair, however, i also love being bald, it feels fresh when its hot and it makes me look more badass, so the question is; is it too weird to buy/use a wig to change hairstyles as a man?.

What is the point of dating if you are super far away from marriage?,"As someone who does not plan on getting married anytime soon, I am wondering what dating does.

How do you guys deal with being ghosted?,"I can’t understand how this is so popular these days. I’ve literally been ghosted by 20 women in a row. It always goes the same way, meet at a bar/somewhere and exchange information (usually Facebook), start chatting, and out of nowhere the messages stay unread and there is no response. 

Let’s look at 2 cases that just happened today:

Know a girl through a friend and I have her number and she messages me for a doobie. I run it out to her and we sit in her car chatting for a while. I send her a message saying maybe we can chat somewhere other than her car. One message, no pressure and no follow up. 2 weeks later she messages me back saying how sorry she was for not responding and that yeah she’s definitely down to chill some time. I say that sounds great, it’s nice out next week how about then some time? No response. Follow up a couple days later with a suggestion, nothing. What gives? She could have just left it at the first message but she messages me back just to ignore me. 

Second girl I met through a job and we chat for a few days online. She is super friendly likes my jokes and the mid conversation she stops reading my messages and never replies again. I didn’t ask her out or anything and she just stops responding in the middle of the convo. I then asked her a couple days later if she likes tacos. No response or anything. 

I’ve noticed no girl ever says no. I ask them if they’re down to get together, they always say yeah sure just later and then when I try to schedule a time it always goes to ghost. 

What is the deal with that? I’m just venting right now but I cannot believe people think it’s acceptable to just stop communicating mid convo. If they just send “not interested” or “no thanks” I wouldn’t ask them again but they always say sure, just not this week. So then I have to ask again and it’s always “sure, later” until it’s a ghost job. Is saying no really that hard?

The worst part is I’m a great conversationalist, very successful, work with music and music festivals, have travelled the world and just want someone to talk to *in person*.  I would always rather talk in person than online, but I cannot get past the text phase. I haven’t been on an actual date in what seems like forever.

"HOW CAN I HELP HIM REALIZE THAT GOING TO THERAPY DOESN'T MEAN HE'S ""WEAK?""","My hubby has a systemic family anger problem---him, his brothers, his dad, his grandfather, so on and so forth and ALL of the men in the family suffer in their relationships because of it. Ironically (and sadly) the only one of the 9 kids in the dad's family who didn't have a severe anger problem, lost his wife to lung cancer---so there's a nice ""here's what happens when you aren't mad at the world"" lesson for the rest of the family.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we're dealing with a jealousy issue that I am getting some assistance for from my own therapist---hubby and I did couples together years ago but recently he's back at the ""there's nothing wrong with me, why would i go?"" stage.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to explain that his anger (specifically toward stronger/more opinionated women) is a learned behavior---literally ALL of the men in his family are like this---and that he can learn a new behavior if that's what he wants--of course he then reminds me that his Dad says ""Shrinks are for f\*gs""-- He says it was ""different"" when we were going as a couple because it wasn't just about him. Here's my subquestions to the question in the title:

1-If his dad and/or brother(s) went to therapy too--either with him in a group or seperately + individually (depending on recommendation of therapist)--what's the hive think are the chances of him opening up to it? 

2-I've explained and so have some other friends and family that therapy isn't really as torturous as so many people make it out to be--you just talk about yourself for an hour! What other points can I make that might help him realize that therapy is actually supposed to be helpful?

3-Help me understand why this is still such a thing! This is an all Irish family and they'd all rather drink and fight than talk about their feelings--with each other or anybody else---when the oldest brother died suddenly a few years ago they ALL (literally all of them) said ""I never got the chance to tell Billy that I loved him..."" and despite this lesson on our limited time in this life, these men are still paralyzed by fear when it comes to potentially emotional situations. How do I tell a manly man that the bravest and toughest thing he can do is be open about his feelings?

How do I get over my feelings for a co-worker?,"So, about four months ago this girl started at the company I work for.

I thought she was attractive from day one, but being able to say the same for several of my female colleagues, it wasn't a major issue. I soon found out she was in a long-term relationship, so again it didn't really worry me too much.

This has all changed in the last few weeks, since we've been assigned to work on a couple of projects together. The more time I spend with her, the more my feelings for her have grown. While most of our conversations are professional and work-based, we get on extremely well and there have been odd moments where we've been flirty with each other, although nothing inappropriate.

Now rational me says she has a boyfriend and telling her how I feel is only going to end in tears and probably affect my job, but I can't shake off how I feel and really want to know if she feels the same way.

I think the problem is that outside of work, I never have an issue asking girls out. Even if I get a flat no, I much prefer that to keeping quiet, and if it's a no I get over it pretty quickly and move on. I've never had this happen at work before, but it's obviously a lot different to chatting to someone in a bar. I also feel like a dick because she has a boyfriend and I know how I'd feel if someone was seriously hitting on my girlfriend, but as much as I try to ignore it, I can't change the way I feel. 

So I guess the question is what should I do? How do I stop this from eating away at me? Is it even worth the risk of saying something?

How can I start feeling okay about not feeling okay?,"I wrote up this comment for a recent askreddit thread but was a bit late to the party. 

I don't tell my girlfriend when I'm sad. Which is pretty often because we're long distance right now. One time I did and immediately felt like I had to apologize and say I'm sorry for being sad and tell her I know that being sad is not attractive. I wish I could just be sad and go to her for support. It's not her fault I just.. don't feel okay being not okay.

This can't be right. We should be allowed to feel not okay. And most people would probably tell me that I should just talk to my girlfriend when I'm sad and tbh, as logical as it is, I just know I probably never will for fear of the repercussions. Especially while we're long distance I feel like I have to be the strong one, and I'm just don't always feel that strong.

How can I be less stressful to my fiance,"So, my fiance and I have been a little rocky for a while. He says he doesnt like to be around me anymore because he finds me very stressful. I have adhd and I've been trying to do better with house keeping and other things, but I'm a very emotional person because of my condition, so I tend to feel things more strongly than others.

Last week he was very loving and we were very happy. This week hes back to being grumpy and withdrawn. Yesterday we had a fight and he wanted to end our relationship. We are still together, but he said that I'm trying too hard to make things better and that im genuinely just a huge source of stress in his life.

He doesnt know exactly what I do that causes him stress, and he has a lot of other sources of stress in his life that make the situation worse. I know men deal with stress different than women. I want to talk things out but the more I try the more distant he becomes.

So, what I'm trying to figure out is what I can do to make things better. I want to be a source of love and support, not frustration and stress. Men who have been in this situation and gotten passed it, what are the actions that I can take to strengthen our relationship?

 We've been together for 8 years and are both really young (mid-life 20s). He has a huge financial burden on his shoulders, as well as school. I'm trying to do overtime at work to help us financially and am working to keep the house clean (clutter also stresses him). He tends to work very late most nights so he comes home already stressed and tired most weekdays.

What can I do to take some stress off of him, or what behaviors tend to hurt a relationship from a mans perspective?

How can I fix things with my girlfriend's parents when I've already messed up.,"Idk if this belongs here but i wasn't getting any help anywhere else.
So my gf and I have been dating for close to 4 months now. However at ab 2 months our parents found out. Her and I were not even sapossed to be talking but we did anyway. So her mom got mad, my mom got mad.
After that her and I started sending notes to one another. (We had a mutual friend who passed them) and that went in for I want to say a month and a half I think. But once again id even know how they found out but our parents found them. So again we got in trouble and we were forbidden to see eachother or talk to eachother.
So after that happened maybe a week after, I decided I needed to apolagize to her mother. We met at a coffee shop and I apolagized and told her I felt bad and I wanted to make this GS right so one day I could see her daughter again. She didn't really budge and said all this stuff ab how she didn't even want us to talk as friends even for maybe two years. 
I half excepted that and half didn't. I started to feel really bad because my girlfriend is going through all this alone by herself and she doesn't have anyone to talk to or ask for help with. And so  through that mutual friend I sent small verbal messages to my gf. Something like I love you so much and I miss you to death. Something small like that but also enough to keep her spirits up.

Well guys no idea how but, her mom found out. So she's in really big trouble I'm in really big trouble. Yesterday my grandpa sat me down (my dad isn't in the picture anymore) and talked to me ab the situation. He helped me understand the parents side of this and how I was wrong ( I didn't see how I was wrong before). But now I understand she's just trying to protect her daughter. I understand that I am in the wrong. I understand that it's her job as a parent. I understand that I was being really stupid before. And I was thinking I know better I'm smarter ik more. Like a dumb teenager. I want to make things right with her and her husband. I want to apolagize. And tell them that I'm sorry that they were right I want to talk to them and help them understand that I was just being a headstrong idiot.
But after the first time. I'm so scared  that she won't except my apolagy. I'm scared that she won't even want to talk. I'm scared maybe I've gone to far and maybe I'll never be able to see my Gf again when we are teens. Or lose her altogether. I love this girl more then anything with all my heart. I can't live without her. I want to do everything I can so I can see her freely again. I need help guys idk what to do or how to do it.

Please men of reddit help me on this one.
Sorry for any mistakes I'm on mobile.",0,"How can I fix things with my girlfriend's parents when I've already messed up.Idk if this belongs here but i wasn't getting any help anywhere else.
So my gf and I have been dating for close to 4 months now. However at ab 2 months our parents found out. Her and I were not even sapossed to be talking but we did anyway. So her mom got mad, my mom got mad.
After that her and I started sending notes to one another. (We had a mutual friend who passed them) and that went in for I want to say a month and a half I think. But once again id even know how they found out but our parents found them. So again we got in trouble and we were forbidden to see eachother or talk to eachother.
So after that happened maybe a week after, I decided I needed to apolagize to her mother. We met at a coffee shop and I apolagized and told her I felt bad and I wanted to make this GS right so one day I could see her daughter again. She didn't really budge and said all this stuff ab how she didn't even want us to talk as friends even for maybe two years. 
I half excepted that and half didn't. I started to feel really bad because my girlfriend is going through all this alone by herself and she doesn't have anyone to talk to or ask for help with. And so  through that mutual friend I sent small verbal messages to my gf. Something like I love you so much and I miss you to death. Something small like that but also enough to keep her spirits up.

Well guys no idea how but, her mom found out. So she's in really big trouble I'm in really big trouble.

Men of reddit: how much of a dealbreaker is your SO's sex history?,"I'm currently in the process of moving on from a recent breakup, and even though it happened for a few other reasons, my past lifestyle before meeting him was one of the things that always put him over the edge. 

He told me he didn't want a future with me and don't see me as wife material, not entirely because of my past, but it's certainly one of the reasons. I was obvs done with that lifestyle the moment we met because I was sure what I had for him was true love. We connected on many things, and actually had a very physical relationship and I had never met anyone like him who matched my sex drive. But he wanted someone who offers much more than that. Coolcoolcoolcool.

Now he's dating a girl who is very much unlike me in many aspects, esp. physically, aaaand what they have now is none of my business. But I just want to know, for future reference, if I should just keep my past promiscuity to myself because apparently it drives some guys crazy?

My gf offered me her late brothers very expensive coat and I didn’t know how to respond to it.,"Her brother passed away not too long ago and she recently came back from bereavement. She brought back a few of his things that she plans to use herself. One of the items she brought Was one of his very expensive winter coat that fits her but she says fits too much like a guys jacket (obv) but she and her family don’t want to throw it away or sell it. 

She said I should wear it. I tried to push it off saying it won’t fit me but she had me try it on and it fit. I turned it down saying a woman wearing an oversized coat is “in” and she can pull it out occasionally. 

I am not sure if that was the right thing to do. Should I take it and store it for her since I know she’s also low on closet space. Should I take it and wear it to remind her of her bro? What’s the right move? I feel like I’m walking on eggshells but want to be there for her.

"17 M, should I be worried about my lack of female friends or acquaintances?","I’m gonna preface this by saying that I’m pretty self-confident, I know that I’m moderately attractive (at least not too ugly), I get a bit nervous around new people, but I’m very comfortable around people that I have gotten to know, and although I don’t have many close friends, I have been getting better at building those kinds of relationships. Obviously, my self-perception is biased, and probably not how everyone else sees me at all, so I might have some glaring faults that I can’t admit to myself that can be the main factor in this. 


I live in a world completely insulated from girls, a boys boarding school. Normally, this would give me some closure, it’s out of my control. However, more and more, I find that people in my year have girlfriends and vast networks of girl acquaintances. I know that I should be networking, to gain access to these circles, but honestly between my cowardice and the fact that friendship groups have been solidified to the point where I can only really be an acquaintance, I am finding it hard to meet girls the way they’re doing it. Now, I start uni next year, I’m sure that even I can find success in a coed environment, but who knows. I’m worried that this problem stems from beyond my environment, but something that’s inherently wrong with me. 

TLDR: how do I meet girls in an environment without any? And, if I fail, how should I improve to make sure that I can succeed in the future?

How does one become assertive or have a backbone?,"I wasn't raised by my parents properly and ended up being raised by my aunts and grandparents. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask it instead of asking at r/Advice but I thought I would be able to receive more help here. My kindness towards people has always been taken advantage of by my friends and now it is worsening as nobody seems to be taking me seriously now. Not that I let them take advantage of me, but I've always been taught to return everything with kindness leading me to grow up having a somewhat feminine personality.

"Straight men: Starting from nothing, how much effort would it typically take you to be able to have sex?","I'm wondering what the general consensus is for going from nothing to having sex and what the process would look like for you.

By nothing I mean no partner, no contacts, no hook ups, in a new area by yourself for work and for as long as necessary.

I don't just mean in the sense of a hookup or a one night thing. Just whatever way you would go through. 

I'm asking because I think I maybe too impatient and I am wondering if I need to recalibrate my belief on this topic. 

Also I ask about sex just because it is the most intimate stage of two people being together but it could just be a part within a bigger goal of a relationship.",0,"Straight men: Starting from nothing, how much effort would it typically take you to be able to have sex?I'm wondering what the general consensus is for going from nothing to having sex and what the process would look like for you.

Why do some men need a lot of attention from women?,"This is something that has come up recently and it’s got me wondering. I know a guy who absolutely loves attention from women. He has a small harem of them in his social life. He’s a quite a flirt but never asks anyone out, as far as I can see. He’s a tad overweight, got a bit of a dad bod that he’s self-conscious about, but is otherwise ok in terms of appearance. He’s also single and early 40s. Personality-wise, he’s funny, generous and perceptive. He’s a likeable guy. 

What is his need for female attention all about?

Am I (F21) leading a guy (26M) on by hanging out with him and not wanting to have sex?,"I (F21) just got out of a long term relationship two weeks ago. This long term relationship was on and off for some years. During one of our breakups, I met someone on Tinder (26M) and we hooked up and hit it off quite well, went on a few dates, etc. After about a week of seeing the tinder guy, I called it off because I still wanted to get back with my ex. Tinder guy was very understanding and I and my ex eventually got back together. Fast forward six months later, my ex leaves me for someone else. This was about two weeks ago. A few days ago tinder guy friend requests me on social media and we plan to hang out. We had a good first date but by the end of it, I told him I wasn't ready to sleep with anyone because I had just got out of a long term relationship. He was very understanding about this. We saw each other again today and we got to making out but I stopped him and told him I wasn't ready. We both got awkward after that and he offered to drive me home. He could see I was pretty quiet on the way back and asked me if there was anything I wanted to talk about and I said no. He told me that if I wasn't ready that was fine with him and I ended up apologizing for not wanting to sleep with him and he didn't say anything after that.

How can I gently persuade my partner to let go of material possessions?,"I've (28m) have lived with my partner (25f) for 4 years now. I love her to bits, but something ive noticed since day 1 is she owns alot of stuff. Before I met her I had travelled and moved around alot, I basically have never really owned much of anything. 

Anyway, 2 years ago we bought our first house. 3 bed 1 bath, we are the only people who live here. We've renovated it since we moved in and I've let her decorate the entire place, it's got a really boho- lots of indoor plants- sit on the rug and drink exotic tea sorta vibe. It looks fantastic, I love what shes done with the place, but every closet in every room is full of stuff, which naturally leaks into the living spaces. Every drawer, every cupboard is stacked full of stuff. It takes hours and hours to clean and organize because there is so much stuff. As a few examples, we have a closet full of painting equipment and blank canvases, like 50+ canvases in there, we paint maybe once per year. Theres a whole double closet full of fabrics, sewing machines, mannequins, and cosplay stuff I've never seen her use since we met. Probably 2 giant storage bins full of dairies, journals, planners, blank books etc but none have ever been used, she has 1 that she uses daily and the rest just sit there. Even stuff like bedding, we have 10 sets of sheets for our bed and 4 different quilt cover options, we only have 1 bed in the entire house, and probably 30 pairs of shoes, half of which have never been worn.

I've never made an issue of it, financially were pretty secure so I've never policed how she spends her money, it's her money. But in a practical sense we are running out of room in this house and i refuse to get a storage lockup, i feel a 3 bed house should be more than enough for 2 people? 

Every 3 months or so I go through my stuff and either donate or bin anything I dont need, she will do the same, but her donate pile is just a few things she really doesnt want. 

How can I help her declutter her life, or atleast make suggestions about letting a few things go to make our day to day lives easier and more practical? I used to ride motorcycles, but I cant see myself buying one anytime in the next 5 years so I sold all my riding gear, and I think this might be a fundamental difference in how we think. She holds on to her cosplay stuff incase she wants to make another outfit one day, despite not making one in 6 years. 

Another option I've considered is hiring a cleaner, which I'm not against if that's what the advice suggests but I've voiced this before and my partner didnt like the idea of someone else cleaning up our own mess and I kinda feel the same. I also dont think shes a hoarder, shes just a creative person who likes having her resources always available, even if they wont be used in the foreseeable future.

"If a guy hooks up with me when drunk, is he still attracted to me when sober?","This guy I know and am friends with always wants to make out when we are drunk, but when sober never tries and usually acts like it didn’t happen.

How do you get a girl’s vagina smell off of your fingers? [NSFW],"Long story short, I met up with a really cute girl for a tinder date and we went back to her house. We watched a movie for a bit and then started getting intimate.

I fingered her for a bit and then kissed down her body to eat her out. I literally stopped right in my fucking tracks, did a figure 8 movement, and came right back up. Shit smelled like onions. But worse.

She asked what was wrong but I told her I usually don’t like to fuck on the first date and I felt as if we should wait a bit more. She bought it and I internally let out the biggest sigh of relief I ever have in my life.

Now, this smell has been lingering all day on my fingers. In fact, the smell is SO BAD that my friend at the gym could smell it. I tried three different soaps and a whole bath but it’s STILL. FUCKING. THERE.

When men realize what they had when it's too late... help us understand,"My ex and I had been together for about three and a half years prior to him breaking up with me. I was very hurt and devastated- this lasted for some months. Eventually I had gotten myself together. Got a great job and new place, I started going back out and hanging with my friends. I had even went on a few dates. I still loved him of course, but I was happily moving on with my life and trying to leave him in the past.

Anyway, I cut all contact with him during that time. Seems like when he noticed I had been moving on with my life and not giving him any attention, that’s when he started doing little things to be around me and get my attention. After a while we eventually got back in contact and slowly started hanging out. He told me that he still loved me and while in mid- conversation had mentioned several times, “if we got back together.” We’ve also talked about it. I’m still confused on if I’d want to at this point. “I feel like I suit myself in the foot,” is what he told me.

Moral of the story. We’re back to hanging out regularly and I’ve had to draw several “friend” boundaries between us because we don’t know how to be just that... friends.

"Men of Reddit, I need your advice to see if I was being dramatic or not.","So, let me get some groundwork out of the way:

I'm 22 y/o, I've been working at a factory for around 8 months. In this factory, my position is with a small group of co-workers (3-4 daily), most of these people have been with me from the start.  Outside of that, I'm part of a group of friends (but I'm really more like a ""third wheel"" if anything).

**Okay, here's how it starts:**

So, last week I was working at my job, and my ""then"" supervisor told me that I was lying about the position I worked at and that I needed to return to my field. So, turns out my records were messed up and it showed worked in a lower part of the job than I did. So listen, last month the factory asked me several times to do 'volunteer help' (i.e work in a different part of the factory outside of your usual) for the holidays, for about four weeks. It think what happened was that I volunteered there so many times atp, that they thought I worked there permanently. So, they changed my records.

After that happened, I obviously went to the front desk to sort the situation. They said they'll look at my history and take care of it. Cool. 

Next week passes, it's still not fixed. So my supervisor comes up and tells me why I'm here and I should be working at the other place. I tell her that I've always here and that they're fixing the situation right now. She tells me to provide proof (since my records weren't fixed, I couldn't), otherwise I would get in trouble for being off-task. I tell my co-workers to vouch for me since they've been with me since the start. They didn't say anything AT ALL, because again...no records, and they didn't want to get in trouble.

So, I spent the rest of the shift working in the wrong position and then spent next SIX hours trying to prove my case, otherwise I could lose my job. I quit my job yesterday and am already working at a different building (same business however).

So, essentially I felt I got punished for something that was completely their fault.

**AFTERWARDS:**

I drive home and I find out I'm out of gas, there's one gas station nearby and I don't have any change. I can't ask any of my family or friends for help, because they're broke too. I ask the people at the gas stalls for help, but they said no. I ask the people inside the store for help, but they kick me out. I call one of my close friends for help cause I know he's gets paid that day, but he didn't even respond. He does that every time I need help. So, I spend the next hour trying to find lose change (it was an open plain, no one cared) to exchange for gas money. I eventually find $1.80 worth of change, which is literally just enough to get to my house. So, I roll out.

FURTHERMORE:

So, I'm pissed about how my day went and I wanted to talk one of my friends about it. I call him and he says he's sleeping. I tell I'll call him later since he's sleeping and I won't bother him, and he angrily responds with 'what do you want?'

I explain to him my situation, involving leaving my job, and the stuff at the gas station. And he just says, ""is that all you called me for?"". ""What do you hope to accomplish?"" I respond by saying, ""I don't want to accomplish anything. I just want you to listen"". I ask him what's wrong with that and he says that he doesn't like that I called him just to chat and that I should only call him ""for important things"". Not just to see ""how my day was"". I tell him fine and to just go back to bed. He hangs up on me.

I lost my MIND after that. Flailing my arms, banging my head on the ground, shouting at the world. I went insane, because I felt like at that moment, NO ONE had my back.

So, I'm pissed about how my day went and I wanted to talk one of my friends about it. I call him and he says he's sleeping. I tell I'll call him later since he's sleeping and I won't bother him, and he angrily responds with 'what do you want?'

I explain to him my situation, involving leaving my job, and the stuff at the gas station. And he just says, ""is that all you called me for?"". ""What do you hope to accomplish?"" I respond by saying, ""I don't want to accomplish anything. I just want you to listen"". I ask him what's wrong with that and he says that he doesn't like that I called him just to chat and that I should only call him ""for important things"". Not just to see ""how my day was"". I tell him fine and to just go back to bed. He hangs up on me.

I lost my MIND after that. Flailing my arms, banging my head on the ground, shouting at the world. I went insane, because I felt like at that moment, NO ONE had my back.

Was I being dramatic?"
"Mid-level office working men: under what circumstances are you told you’re working too hard, or going to burnout?","I am mid-level at a corporate company. I am legitimately doing the work of at least 2 people and haven’t missed a deadline.

7 people in the last two weeks have told me that I am overworking and they are concerned about me burning out. Ive been doing two peoples jobs for 6 months.

I have been burned out in the past and I don’t feel like this is burnout level at all. I’m curious

1) are you told you are overworking/ near burnout by your manager, leadership, and coworkers?
2) how much work were you doing for how long? 
3) what are the warning signs/patterns that you have found in your own habits? 
4) what do you do to rejuvenate? 

If you’re a manager, what are the signs that your employees are working themselves to the bone? Do you encourage them or do you cut them off?

What do you expect from a woman when having sex?,"I (20F) have been in a bunch of different relationships, but sleeping with someone new is always something difficult for me because I feel like a lot of pressure about ""being good in bed"". 

Here's a little bit of context for my question but you don't have to read that, you can just answer the question in general. 

I am now coming to the end of a two year fight with vaginislus, which used to prevent me from having any penetrative sex. This has not stopped me from having a thrilling and inventive sex life with my partners, but I always feel like what I am doing is not as good as it should be. For example, I like giving head but I can't (and don't want to) deepthroat. Or, whether it is a blowjob or handjob, even if the guy is enjoying himself I can't really tell if what he's feeling is kind of generic pleasure or something really good. And I know the easiest way to know is to ask but I find it also really un-sexy to do a debriefing everything that happens in bed everytime. Also I know I can now have sex with penetration but I also know it takes a lot of time for me to ""let it in"" because my muscle just need time to relax. And although I have been sexually active for 2/3 years now, penetration is new for me and I fear that I'm going to be ""boring"" to the next guy I have sex with because of all of that stuff....
I know that is quite a problem about my own confidence as well, but with one of my ex boyfriends, I felt like we had a great, inventive and thrilling  sex life and he always said he had no problem with me having vaginismus, that is was okay, but when we broke up he told me about how frustrated and unhappy I made him because of that illness. So I don't know what's true anymore haha.",0,"What do you expect from a woman when having sex?I (20F) have been in a bunch of different relationships, but sleeping with someone new is always something difficult for me because I feel like a lot of pressure about ""being good in bed"".

How do you deal with extreme body envy?,"Hey all. This is a serious question, so if you answer, please be respectful. I also really hope this is an appropriate subreddit to ask this in.

I realize now just how awkward of a post this is, how taboo it is, etc. I don't believe myself to be homosexual. However, I have come to terms with myself on something: I have a problem with constantly looking at pictures of men that are in great shape, and are young. I myself am young, and in decent shape, but I covet those with muscular physiques. Not because I want have sex with them, but because I want to almost *be* them in, a sense. It's gotten out of control; starting with just thoughts of insecurity, losing focus at the gym when someone with a desirable size is nearby, masturbating to videos and images of muscle worship, and questioning if I have bigorexia or some kind of depression. I think I am attracted to the idea of being a better version of myself. Someone who is more successful, and the big-man in the room. And my biggest takeaway, is that I think this is severely hurting me in the dating field because I am so obsessive over myself, that I constantly am fighting the battle of: ""how can I love someone else if I don't love myself"".

Has anyone suffered from this, to this degree? Am I in a minority? Is this a mental health issue?

But for more context, the last two girls I’ve gone out with have both denied me a second date. What sucks even more is that we seemed to have hit things off really well on the first dates but they’ve just never come back. I’m fine with rejection because it’s just a natural part of life but in the end, I end up feeling a little bit hurt.

What are some possible reasons guys ghost girls they hook up with?,"I recently hooked up with a guy. Turns out I had a lot more in common with him than I thought but I had trouble expressing myself and opening up around him. He seemed into me though.  

Had only really hung out with him three times though. The last time we hung out, we finally had sex but it was pretty awkward and I kept losing the mood. When he dropped me off, I asked if he'd wanna hangout again sometime. 

He told me, ""Yeah, definitely sometime."" 

Then later I go to text him and see what he's doing, turns out he blocked me. Wtf? 

That stung a bit lol.

My brother is a victim of domestic abuse. What can I do?,"My brother is recently married too a woman who is not very nice at all. She's very unpleasant and argumentative as well as negative and derogatory towards pretty much everyone.

But thats not the worst of it and if it was I wouldn't be making this post.

She abuses my brother verbally and emotionally. She is constantly yelling at him and putting him down. When I say constantly I mean CONSTANTLY, she has no shame about it, she will yell in public, at the dinner table and in front of me, my mom and my sister.

But that is still not the worst. She financially abuses him as well. All of his paycheck goes directly to her and she only gives him a small allowance. She does this for her own gain, but also to control his actions as he is only allowed to spend what she let's him spend.

His spending money is virtually nothing and he often has to ask my mom to buy him things, like entrance fees when we go to do things, restaurants and on one occasion even clothes... All this from a man who has a full time job and makes €40k per year.

But what gets me the most is his attitude to it... He doesn't believe there is anything wrong.

My brother has had a troubled past. He has struggled with his career, with depression and with alcohol and he has very low self esteem. He says he doesn't care about her yelling because he does make mistakes and he doesn't care about the money because he doesn't know how to handle money himself.

But I know my brother. He is beaten down and is unhappy and afraid to express himself. He shakes like a cowering dog at the first sign of conflict... It is very disheartening to see that in your older brother.

I have been objecting lately and the wife has pretty much removed herself and my brother from the family as a result. We only get to see him very rarely.

What have been your experiences with girls who take a while to text back?,"I've been on 2 dates with this girl, and we had a great time, kissed on the first, had dinner at her place on the second and cuddled and made out on the couch.

Straight guys: What is the dating etiquette for informing a man about your period?,"Okay this sounds oddly specific, but since it’s a situation that me (f22) and my girlfriends frequently have been in and  discussed, I thought this might be the place to get some answers. 

The situation is as follows: you’re dating a guy in the casual way that seems so common nowadays,meaning that you started by hooking up. Now you’re doing it frequently. It has not yet been established if you’re headed towards more than sex, but sometimes you’ll do other things like watch a movie, cook some food, get a drink at your place etc. Sex always happens, but when you make plans, you do it to see each other and you always plan an activity. It’s not a “hey wanna hook up”- type of arrangement although you always end up in bed. Maybe you hope it will lead to something more. So what do you do, when you have a date planned and you’ll be on your period? 

Is there some kind of etiquette to whether you need to “warn” the guy beforehand that it is that time of the month, so he knows sex might not happen or there’ll be blood involved?
My friends and I always feel awkward bringing it up on text and especially if you like them, you don’t want to assume the sole purpose of the date is to hook up. We know not having sex is not the end of the world, but also don’t want the guy to show up expecting it and be disappointed. 

Since this keeps happening to us (maybe cause we bleed every month lol), it’d be really nice to hear some male thoughts on what’s the best way to handle this and if there’s some sort of period-informing social etiquette that we’re missing out on.",0,"Straight guys: What is the dating etiquette for informing a man about your period?Okay this sounds oddly specific, but since it’s a situation that me (f22) and my girlfriends frequently have been in and  discussed, I thought this might be the place to get some answers.

Peeing Instead of Having an Orgasm Help!,"Hi everyone, I posted this in r/sex but perhaps this might be a more suitable subreddit. 

I've only had one orgasm in my 26 years. It was with a shower-head...but unfortunately I moved and had to try different techniques/tools since then. Fingering, dildos, PIV, even oral all feel great but none of them have made me climax. 

Recently I bought a clit stimulator (which feels incredible). It quickly builds me up but instead of getting me to that big O, all it does is make me pee. It's definitely peeing and not squirting. And once I do pee, all that build up just dissipates. I've tried using the restroom beforehand but it still happens. Once I tried powering through it and just kept going but only went on to pee again...so I'm pretty frustrated at this point and would appreciate suggestions!",1,"Peeing Instead of Having an Orgasm Help!Hi everyone, I posted this in r/sex but perhaps this might be a more suitable subreddit.

If women tell you you’re good at oral sex are they being polite or do they mean it.,"So I’m not very good at taking compliments and have some self esteem issues (which are my issues to deal with) so I often think compliments are people just being nice (I’m working on a lot of things about myself).

I’ve been told, unprompted, by every girl (which is only 4) that I’ve performed oral sex on that I was really good at it.  I enjoy performing it and hope that that is the case for my partners, but like I said I struggle with compliments or thinking that I’m good at things.  I’ve never asked the women I’m with because I don’t want to be cuddling and ask them if they’re lying about their complement.  It would, obviously, pad my self esteem but that’s not what I’m looking for (to be honest it wouldn’t hurt though), but I want to be honestly good at it (I’ve bought a book and was told I don’t need it by a partner).

I’m not looking for a humble brag or to make any generalizations about women, but I just want to know if it was something to make me feel good about myself or an actual compliment, or there very well could be no answer because everyone is different.",1,"If women tell you you’re good at oral sex are they being polite or do they mean it.So I’m not very good at taking compliments and have some self esteem issues (which are my issues to deal with) so I often think compliments are people just being nice (I’m working on a lot of things about myself).

"Is there such a thing as ""menstrual privilege""?","Nowadays we hear about many different forms of privilege, most of which isn't even related to factors anyone can change, but rather based on genetics. Things like ethnicity, skin color, sexual orientation, gender, etc.  Well, does that mean some female-bodied people have ""menstrual privilege""?

This topic came up while talking with one of my coworkers (a cis woman) about what it's like living with gender dysphoria (I have never, ever considered myself a woman, though I do acknowledge my body is female, and do my best to present as masculine without taking hormones). One of her first questions was ""but how can you think of yourself as a guy, when you're suffering from PMS/period cramps/bowel issues/etc.?"" I let her know that I've been having a period since I was 8.5 years old (I'm 33 now) and have never once experienced what most women complain about, so I really am like a male in as much as I can sympathize but have no idea what it's actually like. 

She initially didn't believe me, saying that ""all women get cramps and mood swings no matter what"". But after searching online we found that roughly 7-15% are like me and don't experience any negative symptoms at all. It's literally just a few days of ""oh, I'm bleeding"" and that's it, with a slightly increased appetite, I'm assuming from the loss of nutrients.

My question is, does this count as a privilege? If it doesn't yet, should it? Would it only be considered a privilege in the trans community, specifically for other transgender female-bodied people, as it can help us identify as masculine easier? Is there anything ""easy period"" people can do to help people who do suffer from difficult periods?",1,"Is there such a thing as ""menstrual privilege""?Nowadays we hear about many different forms of privilege, most of which isn't even related to factors anyone can change, but rather based on genetics.

Advice for a guy at the gym,"Hey! Just a little context about myself. I normally don't have a problem approaching women. Breaking the ice isn't always the best thing for me but I do it anyway.

Earlier today, I spotted a woman that I've been seeing at the gym for awhile and I kind of have my eyes on her. While I was working out, the girl that I was interested in was working out in front of me within eye view. Now I had another girl next to me that I had spoken to before, and I wanted to say hi to her but didn't. I chose not to because I didn't want to do so in front of the woman I was actually interested in. So I said nothing. Another woman I had spoken to before was right next to me a few minutes later and I chose not to say anything to her either because the woman I liked was within proximity. Am I weird for this?? I guess I'm just being careful so it doesn't seem like I'm trying to talk to every girl at the gym, especially if she might have an interest in me too. Idk.",1,"Advice for a guy at the gymHey!

Kyleena IUD,"So tmr I am getting the Kyleena IUD inserted in the morning. This will be my second IUD, I had the Mirena IUD before and I was in constant pain so I got it removed. I decided to give IUD’s another chance since I have severe endometriosis and PMDD. Prior to this me and my man have been having unprotected sex for almost a year now every ovulation week/day and I haven’t gotten pregnant once (only one chemical pregnancy and an early miscarriage) so I decided to stop trying to have a baby since I have assumed the world has spoke and said right now just isn’t my time. Was wondering about anyone else’s experience with the Kyleena IUD, since I am extremely paranoid. I was suppose to get the smallest IUD (Jaydess/ Skyla) but it has been discontinued in Canada, so my pharmacist could not order it for me.

Girl I am dating having trouble with sex. What can I do to help her?,"I am 28M. 22F girl.

Last night we finally went back to my place. We got naked. I’m not new to this, I know how important foreplay is. I made sure she was comfortable for a good 10-20 minutes teasing her, kissing her neck, etc.


I went to put my hand down on her clitoris, very slowly,  very gently and I feel her squirm/crawl into a ball. You can tell it is EXTREMELY sensitive.

Sex was not even an option. We got the tip of my pecker in and she began to squirm and I felt like my foreskin was about to rip due to the tightness. 

She tells me it has been 1.5 years since her last sexual encounter. Not sure if I believe that since she is an attractive 22 y/o girl. 

I feel like she might have gone through some trauma or something? She was apologising and I could tell she was insecure about it. 

I want her to know I’d like to work with her. I just don’t know why this happens? I’ve had sex with over 30 women and never had one with a clitoris so sensitive and a vagina so tight. 

Should I ask her if she’s had trauma? Or to accompany her to a gynocologist?

"Women that actively decided not to have children, how did you come to that decision?","I want to first explain that I am very aware that there are hundreds of thousands of women that maybe would have chosen to become pregnant and give birth and have children, and couldn't due to various reasons out of their control.

In this post, I'm specifically curious to hear from women that, as far as they knew/know, had or have the opportunity to have children, and have made the decision not to do so. Please share anything relevant that comes to mind about your experience, that you might wish to share with someone that is also considering not trying for children.

The reason that I am asking is not at all from a place of judgement - it's actually the opposite. I'm in my mid-late twenties, and am not sure whether I want to have kids. Some days I happily imagine having 4 kids, some days I happily imagine having no kids. Some days the sacrifices and challenges seem worth it, some days the sacrifices and challenges don't seem worth it. So, I'm basically just wanting to talk to women who have experienced both so I can better understand my own feelings about it. I'll probably make another post asking the same of women that actively decided to try for children.

Thanks in advance for any sharing.",1,"Women that actively decided not to have children, how did you come to that decision?I want to first explain that I am very aware that there are hundreds of thousands of women that maybe would have chosen to become pregnant and give birth and have children, and couldn't due to various reasons out of their control.

Went to the doctor right away who took a swab test and confirmed the next day that I’ve tested positive for HSV-2.

Said that it is quite likely I got infected fairly recently given the serious symptoms which he termed the first outbreak as recurrent outbreaks wouldn’t be as serious. Said I can take a blood test to confirm for antibodies. I was prescribed Valtrex and will be going back to the doctor to discuss suppression treatment.

Safety Tips for a woman who will be watching a ranch (likely) alone for nearly a month in a rural area,"*WARNING: This is a very long and detailed post*

Hello everyone,

I know the title may raise red flags regarding my decision to do this, though I’m only seeking support and tips to help me feel as prepared as possible. Please and thank you all very much! 

The details:

I am a single woman in my mid-20’s watching my uncle’s ranch in a rural area for about 24 days by myself 2 states away from home. I had a friend who was going to stay with me for a chunk of that time, though that doesn’t seem likely now. He has about 10 dogs and a lovely pig who all sleep in the house with him and his wife. In that sense, I have a feeling of security. In addition, he has a variety of animals both large and small in the ranch that I’ll be with and responsible for during this time. 

I have one major concern about this trip- their neighbor. The land is very spacious, so much so that I can barely see his home, though his friendship with my uncle has him coming around very often. He is in his late 60’s, a bit stout, and he lives with his mother who he cares for all day, which seems to be the primary thing keeping him occupied. From my past visits, he has made me feel uncomfortable at certain times and has made himself look relatively obvious to even my father and his girlfriend. He has a dog who hangs out at my uncle’s all day with the others- I feel that he’d use this as an excuse to show up unannounced. He seems (too) comfortable coming around freely. 

Though I haven’t felt particularly threatened by him, I am very concerned about the idea of being potentially alone on this property for this long and feel like I need to prepare for the worst.

Perhaps this seems like a foolish decision, though I am going to move out later this year to the state I’ll be in at the ranch late March, and I have the opportunity to check out apartments in which I’ll be living alone in for the first time. They are paying me a huge sum of money which could help me potentially secure myself a place during this time. They are providing me with a car to drive (there are also more on the property that are functional), and they’ve paid for my round trip ticket. I want to take advantage of the opportunity and be able to feel confident and secure in my ability to take every precaution I can to be safe. I am still in search of at least one person to stay with me for a portion of this time. 

Further details about the property and surrounding area:

The two homes that my uncle has on the property and wooden structures for all of the animals are all pretty close to each other, with the property beyond stretching quite aways (it’s a medium/large plot of land with wire fencing). There are two homes on the property. The guest home is newly built, the main house is two stories and much older. There is a porch light that I believe is motion sensitive, and my uncle’s talkative companion/best friend parakeet who is either going to be on my shoulder all day and then in his cage at night. There is no way I wouldn’t know if someone was approaching. 

I am a 5-10 minute drive from the main grocery store, gas station, and other small businesses of the small town. The landscape is relatively mountainous, though we are at a much lower altitude, basically at the base alongside a shallow river.

Mainly, I am looking for tips on how to secure both homes, particularly the one I’ll be in with farmhouse wear and tear, prepare myself within the home (weapons short of guns like tasers, wasp spray, etc.) and other strategies to optimize a feeling of safety and security. I have until March 23rd to prepare accordingly.

I also would like tips on how to repel this person as best I can and draw hard boundaries without provocation if possible. I am open to suggestions from any of the experiences you have had/thought of/believe are relevant and helpful to this, though I want to keep things realistic and practical. 

I want to stress that I am not trying to inflate or exaggerate the situation- perhaps there isn’t much to worry about, though of course I can’t not think of the worst (especially with the instances of feeling uncomfortable, unfamiliarity, and further context I need not mention) so I’m prepared just in case. 


If there is any more I can add, please let me know! Once again, thank you all in this community in advance for taking the time to read this and possibly respond, I appreciate your support 💙",1,"Safety Tips for a woman who will be watching a ranch (likely) alone for nearly a month in a rural area*WARNING: This is a very long and detailed post*

How do I stop thinking about sex?,"Horny all the time. Need advice

Okayyyyyyy. 
So I (22F) am in a relationship with a guy (25M), let’s call him “K”.
I’ve been with him since an year. Things have been pretty good with us, we’re head over heels for each other and I’m quite happy and satisfied with that. The only thing that has bothered me while all this time is my sexual urges. I think about sex all the time, I have all these sexual fantasies in my mind that I want to do but K on the other hand has low sexual drive. 

In the beginning, everything was okay. We used to have sex all the time but then things changed and now since past three months, his libido has relatively decreased and it’s been so frustrating for me. I want to have lots and lots of sex. I’ve talked about this to him several times, but nothing has changed. It has come to a point where I start fighting with him over this and feel like having sex with someone outside instead of being with him. 

And yeah, my constant frustration has also led me to masturbate a lot of times and he is not aware of it. 

One more thing, I’m young and I want to do crazy stuff whereas K is not as adventurous as me. I want to
explore a lot of things but he doesn’t feel like it. 

I really don’t know what to do. I love him, I love him so much but I just cannot control my sexual urges. I’ve read some posts here, numerous people have suggested me to focus somewhere else or find a hobby. Tbh, I work 8 hours every day and have stuff to do sometimes when I come back home. Besides this I still feel horny all the time and I really need some help.",1,"How do I stop thinking about sex?Horny all the time. Need advice

Nearly all of my online dating interactions are super scary and I think I'm developing trauma from it all after a year. Have you had similar experiences?,"I've tried OKCupid, Bumble, Tinder and local sites, and most men just come across as extremely pushy, entitled, arrogant and creepy, demanding to meet immediately (usually in a shady place even), requiring naked pics or very quickly being sexual, and whenever I say no and try to slow them the fuck down, they continue insisting and threaten to stop talking with me, so I instantly block them.

I'm a trans woman and I'm open about that in my profile so as not to waste time (a lot of people still don't read my profile though, but when I do make them aware of it myself, they instantly change the conversation towards the aforementioned directions), so I guess most men do not see me as anything more than an easy lay or someone probably desperate enough to sext with them / get naked pics from and then to be blocked.

But this really makes me start to distrust men in general - what if someone were once really good at hiding their true colours and I'd eventually get assaulted or worse (I always meet strangers only in well-lit and crowded public places and tell my friends where I'm at, but yeah), if most do not seem to care at all about respecting my boundaries, nor me as a person in general.

I am mainly wondering if others on here also have similar experiences or if it has more to do with me being trans.",1,"Nearly all of my online dating interactions are super scary and I think I'm developing trauma from it all after a year.

Prozac and birth control,"So I am on 40mg of fluoextine (antidepressant) for my depression and mild anxiety, as well as Levlen (birth control) for controlling periods and being able to have freely unprotected sex with my boyfriend. I’m 23, have been on the pill since I was 15, and on antidepressants since I was 17.

I have heard mixed reviews regarding not taking the pill and your mood changing immensely (for the better), but I’m unsure if this won’t work for me due to my Prozac dose?

What shall I tell in a job interview why I quit my old job? The true reason is quite complicated,"Hey I’m pretty new here and if I posted this wrong, please tell me where I shall post it. 

So, after Uni I started working in a company in which i had to fly to Serbia for a week with a male colleague. It were my first 2 weeks in this company, so I thought everything’s good. 
Right on the first evening he clearly stepped above his borders and it was quiet traumatizing for me. I kept it to myself because I really needed that job. I told myself that I need at least 2 years of experience to move on. Almost 2 years later now, I’m looking for a job pretty urgently because I would have to work directly with this guy since the company is restructuring and I really couldn’t bear even hearing him  breath while he was passing me. My boss knows about what happened, but anyways (long story). 
I’m looking for a new job over half a year now and i always get invitations for interviews, but when it comes to the question why I quit, it always is the same. Either I tell the truth which is humiliating (for me) and they think I’m one of “that women” or I make up some basic reasons which aren’t really convincing. 
I’d like to ask you guys if you have any advice on how I can solve this situation for the next interview? It will be next week and I’m already thinking just about that one question.

Why is it assumed that a man wants to get in pants of a girl and not want a romantic relationship (which does involve getting in her pants but its different). 

Its not a loss for both. But if it is then its loss for both."

For what reason do some women starfish in bed?," A woman posted a comment on another post saying that women who starfish are doing it most of the time because the man didn't put efforts in making it pleasurable for her. She talked about her own experience with a guy, she basically stopped investing herself when she saw he wasn't invested in her. And she talked about one of her friend's experience, where the guy would complain that her girlfriend was being a starfish, but she told her it was because she expressed to him she'd like him to be more invested but he didn't listen and she basically felt kinda abused many times while he just saw it as her being a starfish.

Anyway I'm bad at explaining english in not my first language.

I need advice! How did you reclaim your life after sexual assault?,"I was molested as a child, and went on to become a repeat victim throughout my adolescence and early 20's.

I am hesitant to tell my parents what happened, (as one of my abusers was one of my parents parent) I don't want to cause them the pain of a) knowing that their child was raped and b) of knowing that their parent was one of the people responsible.

What do I do about a fellow coworker in a potentially abusive marriage?,"We are all in the military. She (21F) got married to her husband after two months of dating, and within 6 months of checking in to her first command. Husband (separated honorably from our command this year)  has a bad reputation, particularly with other junior enlisted men, for being a “slimy fucking tool”, as my boyfriend puts it. Needless to say, she gets a LOT of judgement from our peers for being a stereotype. 

He’s shown red flags since before they were married (“I’m not allowed to be out past 10pm”- this was said while he was living in another state! “I wanted a full sleeve, but I’m not allowed to get anymore tattoos”). She came to me last night crying about a fight they got into- he was verbally abusing her. I don’t know both sides- but you can’t  berate someone no matter what the backstory is. They fight every 1-2 weeks. She mentioned him watching YouTube videos about “controlling your woman”.  He was at the gym while we were talking, and she couldn’t come to my house because he would have been mad at her, and she was afraid for him to come home. 

I mostly listened, gave a little advice, and recommended the family resource center on base for marriage counseling and tools for teaching them how to communicate/ fight.  A few hours later, she texted me saying that he apologized.

I guess I’m just kind of torn- I refuse to be an enabler and watch someone be abused, but I’m afraid she won’t come to me or anyone (if/when it escalates) if I report  these instances to my chain or give her an ultimatum. Honestly, I am just not trained for this and I feel so lost. My heart hurts.

I would post this to my branch’s specific subreddit, but I’m pretty sure she’s on there.

I love my mom, but the way she lives her life is exhausting and I feel as if she has been drowning me for my entire life. She is a 60 year old woman who has battled with mental health for as long as I can remember. Because of this she has been unable to, in the decade + since divorcing with my father, been able to create a stable living environment for herself or me. 

About six months ago I moved back home from college because I was struggling mentally and also because I wasn't prepared for success as an adult and a student. I thought that coming home was the right decision, but my life with my mother has been very rocky. We're currently facing eviction because she signed a no-pets apartment despite having two. This was supposed to be a time for me to work on myself and learn the skills for success I wasnt taught as a child. Yet i feel like we are at the same place we were years ago. 

I resent my mom a lot even though I have an incredible amount of empathy for her because of her trauma. I am so angry with her that she has failed to be what I need het to be. I am terrified that I am never going to be able to finish school or accomplish any of my dreams because she is like rocks in my pockets in the middle of the sea. I don't want to live her life, but it feels inevitable. I know that living independently would be the best thing for me, but I have terrible credit, student loans and work a minimum wage job.

What would you do if you discovered that the man who molested you (and got away with it) now operates a wedding venue and has a newborn granddaughter in his care?,"In middle school I was groomed and molested by my best friend's father. It was not his first time. He molested me, both of his daughters, and his niece (and that's just who I know about). The state's attorneys office decided not to pursue charges as I did not want to testify against him in court. It was a very traumatic experience, and at the time I felt that every adult in my life failed me.

Well, 15 years later I googled him. He is now operating a wedding/small concert venue, and my former best friend lives there with her daughter. If you were in my position, would you feel you had a responsibility to pursue this? I am hesitant to re-open this wound, but I don't want to be one of the adults who fails this girl, like so many did me.",1,"What would you do if you discovered that the man who molested you (and got away with it) now operates a wedding venue and has a newborn granddaughter in his care?In middle school I was groomed and molested by my best friend's father.

Lowering libido,"Anyone had any success with natural ways to lower libido?

"Ladies who wear leggings, how do you decide what the limit is?","While I understand everybody's different perspectives on women's fashion, this particular trend still escapes me sometimes.

I get that they're comfortable and I've seen plenty of them that are appropriately proportioned and flattering but not overly revealing.

However, I live in a large urban metropolis and see all kinds of expressions of this fashion. I literally walked by a young lady who had wider hips in skin tight light colored leggings that was *literally* parading her snatch around. I mean, labia minora majora the works. I did stare or study her, I was walking the opposite direction and it was like ""ok three ladies walking together and that one has her pussy out"".

She was definitely mild mannered and not some kind of street walker, so I wondered if she had mirror checked before she went out and thought about saying her clothes were malfunctioning.  I didn't, obviously, bc I didn't want to embarrass her and getting screamed at for being a sexist or pervert is not a goal of mine today.

That said, how do women decide what the limit for this stuff is?  I don't think anybody needs to be ashamed of their body but I also feel like there is a place for it.

So my question is like assuming you liked a guy and there was chemistry and he was generally confident, how much of a turn off would being a 25 year old virgin be to you, and when do you think I should mention it (like should I wait until we get to doing physical stuff or be more upfront about it like on the first date), also how much off a turn off is it if I am like shy sexually at first because of the lack of experience?

Can both Bartholin Glands become infected at the same time?,"Jan. 7 two days before the end of my period I noticed that the left side of my labia minora around the 7'o clock part was a lot more redder than the rest and felt like a pimple was gonna form. I then decided to clean it up by pouring warm water over the area which I think caused, caused a very small bump / pimple to burst, because it bled the tiniest bit. Almost like a blood blister? It only stung the one time I peed over it then it wouldn't sting anymore. Now, my vagikna has bit a bit dry and I think the friction caused it to infect the exact opposite side which was similar to the left side at around the 5'o clock part of my labia minora.  A small pimple burst and secreted the most tinest bit of blood. I continued to clean them with very warm water and took 1 antibiotics (amoxicillin) a day which caused them to heal up continuosly overnight from the 10th until today. They were the slightest bit of itchy and slight discomfort because the skin of the infected areas of my labia minora rubbed against each other when I walked. My discharge is a thick white, though. Could it be an std? Or was it probably just an irritation from my period that affected the glands? Because exactly on the 7th I ran out of pads that I had to use old cotton underwear as a substitute, which would wedgie into my vagina.",1,"Can both Bartholin Glands become infected at the same time?Jan. 7 two days before the end of my period I noticed that the left side of my labia minora around the 7'o clock part was a lot more redder than the rest and felt like a pimple was gonna form.

Help me not be an asshole about my housemate,"I (mid thirties) live with another girl (also mid thirties). Everything is great....except the overnight guest thing. I have a boyfriend who stays over once a week at most - usually once ever 2-3 weeks (other times I'm at his). We're in bed at a reasonable hour and done having sex by 12/1am at the very latest - we both have things going on at the weekend and can't sleep in too much. 

She likes to go out on a Friday / Saturday night and come in at 3am and have sex with a guy until 6 in the morning (loudly) then sleep until 1 or 2pm, wake up and do it all over again. Her bed also bangs against my wall even though I've asked her tons of times to move it just an inch or two back from the wall. The noise is so loud it wakes me up. She once had sex with a guy overnight, then he left and she had someone else come over in the afternoon and had sex with him. I get home on a Saturday afternoon and would like to relax but again...noisy sex prevents me from chilling out.

I'm a bit more conservative in my lifestyle, I guess. I drink, but not too much, I'm active and eat healthy, and have professional goals I'm working towards. On the other hand, she likes to get wasted (and finds it hilarious) and have sex with guys from Tinder into the early hours. I find it frustrating that I am trying to be successful in life and the hours she keeps (and sometimes what she chooses to do in those hours) and having a detrimental effect on that success. I'm writing this from a coffee bar because she has a guy with her and when I got home it was really loud, and I don't want to sit in my living room and listen to all her fuck noises. 

Even though this is stressing me out, I feel like I'm being judgmental and unfair. It's her house too, and if this is how she chooses to live her life, she has every right to. She certainly shouldn't change because I don't like it. I've tried using positive thinking and all kinds of mental trickery to be okay with it, but I can't stop feeling uncomfortable. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I really need some tips on sucking it up and blocking it out.",1,"Help me not be an asshole about my housemateI (mid thirties) live with another girl (also mid thirties).

"She likes me but is still harboring feelings for someone else, what should I do.","I have a female friend who I met earlier this year and really hit it off with. She dated a guy for most of last year and they broke up at the end of the summer, I don't 100% know the details of why or who broke up w/ whom.  We are both in college at a small school and see each other pretty much every day, about a month and a half ago we ended up alone in a room together and she told me she had a crush on me and had been flirting with me for at least a month and wanted to know how I felt. I had no idea probably bc I'm terrible at reading stuff like that but I told her I liked her too. We had a 2 week long weird hookup thing where we were hanging out almost every night and talking a lot.  Then we both went back home for winter break, we had sex on the last night before we left and she knew that sex wasn't just a casual thing for me because I've only really had sex with 2 other girls both of whom I had real feelings for.  She would say she really liked me and initiate things even though she's a little shy and I felt like we had a lot in common and things were going well.  Before break, on the night we had sex, she told me her ex had told her earlier that day that he still had feelings for her and it was bringing up some indecision on her part, but she maintained she does really like me and doesn't want to get back together with him but what he said just brought up memories and she was a little confused.  Break is about to end and we talked almost every day over break sometimes for hours. 

That is until yesterday when she said she wants to take a break and just be friends.  I think things can get lost in translation over text and I tend to overanalyze in situations like this so I just want a third party opinion on what, if anything I can do to handle this.  We had a decently long text conversation in which she first sent kind of like a cliche I just want to be friends for a bit text, then gradually changed over to not necessarily wanting to cut things off but just take a step back. She said she meant everything she said and she really does like me but it's not fair to either of us if her heart isn't fully in it and she ""just wishes \[she\] would have taken a little bit more time to make sure I was over \[him\]"".

I put a less detailed version of this on a more male-oriented forum and all I got was people saying she manipulated me or I failed the test or she just wants to fuck her ex etc....  I do feel like I generally have a good sense of character and I was good friends with her for a few months before anything happened and I don't think she's a bad person; she was upfront and honest the whole time.

I do feel like I generally have a good sense of character and I was good friends with her for a few months before anything happened and I don't think she's a bad person; she was upfront and honest the whole time. We both agreed we should definitely talk in person when we get back, what should I say?

tl:dr hooked up with friend I really like but shes harboring feelings for someone else"

Does being pregnant really entitle you to be a shitty person at work?,"Got a female manager at the kitchen I woke in. She is about 5 months pregnant and driving everyone up the wall. I get that it’s a process and she’s gonna let some hormones out but she has become and absolute tyrant and monster. 

The kicker? I have 7 days left at my job before I move. If I quit they bump all my hours worked down to minimum wage (I’d lose like $100-200 that paycheck) but it seems worth it. I’d just quietly tell her “due to your mental instability you convinced someone who had less than a week left to quit, lose out on $150 they already worked for...just to get away from you...that’s how bad you are” I know she would cry in the office for like an hour and honestly that’s what I want. 

I’m genuinely not trying to be misogynistic but, this is her second pregnancy, from what the other guys told me it wasn’t that bad the first time so now it seems like an excuse just for her to be bitchy. Normally when she is being uppity (before pregnancy) my GM would reign her in but now that she is pregnant she basically runs the shift even if the GM is there. 

If I quit both of my shift leads said they would give me good personal references and explain the real reason I left the restaurant. 

I’d gladly make a scene and lose out on a bunch of money I need to move if it means putting her in her place. Honestly we are so short staffed my GM would spam call me to come in the next day because those double shifts don’t work themselves and no one else but me really works them.",1,"Does being pregnant really entitle you to be a shitty person at work?Got a female manager at the kitchen I woke in.

How would you react ?,"Hey so I'm 25(M) and I wanted some clarification.

The thing is it makes me very uncomfortable to think that I can be aroused by something totaly different from what I used to (I'm in my daily life I'm someone very ""manly"" and competitive, so it goes against my value to surrender to a man.. yeah I'm maybe a little homophobic ?). I feel like less of a man for having thoses fantasy. My girlfriend is so sweet, kind, I love her seriously, but she is so ""immature"" and innocent when it comes to sex that I fear she won't understand.

"Woman who become Very Sexually aroused by Horror, I wish to understand why and maybe the feeling the horror gives you as compared to those who do not feel aroused.","So to set this question up im a 6,4 dude and last years Halloween I decided to go as Michael Myers. I recently became a huge fan of the whole series and with how easy it is to be him at least costume wise I go all out.

Get a High Quality Mask, Coveralls , Realistic Knife and Boots.

Now I live in city where every thursday we have a street fair. People sell all kinds of things and a bunch of people show up and walk around this year Halloween fell on Thursday but I decided on top of giving candy out on the big day I would also give it out every Thursday as alot of kids do go to the street fair.

Pack up on a lot of candy and feel excited to hand some candy out. It was a hit. Alot of people pulled me aside for photos and such and alot of people had fun seeing me even the kids who went screaming hehe. Above all though I noticed that quite A few women were..... very flirty. One was walking with her husband and even blew me a kiss. One I remember very well where a group of woman came up to take  pictures and one started Twerking on me. "" Yea get that Knife in her Michael "" they chanted.

This would happen every Thursday and it happened the most on Halloween as that night the Woman I thought were aggressive before were simply Nuns compared to Halloween night women. ""Choke me Mikey"" was the topic of the night. Their words not mine.

All in all it was a fun Halloween and all that happened with the women in the end was funny if not unusual id just never in my life ever experienced something like that before.

The thing though it doesnt stop there the coveralls for the costume are really comfy when I dont feel like getting dressed I just put those on and go about my business. I have 2 pins of Michael on them but even then sometimes is do get advancements even without the mask on.

The last one was when I was at IHOP. The waitress the lit up like a fire cracker when she saw my get up. ""Its just Im in love with the thrill of being chased and helpless to stop him"" We had a good talk.

I’m not sure if she’s interested.,"So there’s this somewhat new girl that works in my building. I’ll start off by saying I’m not usually one to introduce myself/talk to anyone just in passing in the hallways. I’ll list the sequence of events over the past few months as objectively as I can which leads to my uncertainty. 

- First time I see her, I think “hey pretty girl in the Building just to get some food” (my building is one of few that has a cafe on our campus... somewhat irrelevant). 

- we pass each other again later the same week, and she says “oh hey I’ve noticed/seen you around a few times :)” and I mutter/spit something out like “oh yeah :&amp;” I soon find out her office is down the hall from mine 

- another week passes by, I’m bringing my coffee upstairs in the morning, she has just come in to the building and is behind me and she says, “hey I like your socks (I have socks with my dogs face printed on them)”. We stopped and had a bit of a conversation, I finally formally introduce myself to her as were walking back to our offices. I ask if she’s new, what department she works in, and we go our separate ways to our offices, ending it with a polite “I’ll see you around :)”

- a few weeks pass by filled with a handful of moments of passing each other in the hallways and saying only hello to each other. One Friday morning, as we pass I say, “hey happy Friday”. Another week goes by and we pass each other again, and she says “hey happy Friday :)”. This time, I stopped to make small talk with her about her thanksgiving break plans. 

Since then it’s been moments like these, filled with saying hello to each other as we pass, sometimes making small talk about our holiday breaks. A lot of the time I’m eating lunch on our floor’s common area and 9 times out of 10, shell pass through and well say hello. There was one time recently I went back out to my car in the morning to grab my water bottle, and as I was heading back into the building, she had just arrived for the day and she holds the door for me and goes “where’s your jacket?!?! It’s so cold out!”, and I tell her I was just grabbing something out of my car, she says she sometimes sees people not wear jackets when it’s 25degF out... you get the point. 

Anyway, is she interested and/or am I  over analyzing things?

I have been on dates, but they never went anyone. I went to parties but meeting random people never felt right to me. 

I graduated from grad school and I still have this fear of being too pushy and I’m probably too picky. However I’m trying to not focus on relationships or dating, I am trying to better myself and what not right with eating healthy, exploring more, getting more into religion and a better workout routine.

However I’m pretty stressed that I’ll get to 25 and be this much better person who has fixed problems of the past but it will be too late and a huge red flag that I’m so inexperienced and not focusing on fixing this problem anytime soon.

I am also worried after waiting this long just kissing a random stranger. I am a romantic at heart and want it to be someone I care about.",1,"Help: I’m way too old to never have kissed someoneHello, I am in desperate need of some help. The title says it all.

How to be sensitive,"I find myself, as a women in my late 20s, having the kids conversation with my friend's more and more often. i dont not want kids, and am not ashamed or embarrassed about saying it. but what i hate is when my friends, who have kids or want them, become uncomfortable when i express this. usually i get a very defensive response. i wonder if there is a way to speak about my life choices without making my friends feel uncomfortable or like they have to defend their choice to have children. i am hoping to get suggestions for how to be more sensitive, to help my friends feel like they dont have defend themselves just because i have made different choices than they have. I never want to be shamed for not having kids, and I certainly don't want to make anyone else feel shamed for wanting them.",1,"How to be sensitiveI find myself, as a women in my late 20s, having the kids conversation with my friend's more and more often. i dont not want kids, and am not ashamed or embarrassed about saying it. but what i hate is when my friends, who have kids or want them, become uncomfortable when i express this. usually i get a very defensive response. i wonder if there is a way to speak about my life choices without making my friends feel uncomfortable or like they have to defend their choice to have children. i am hoping to get suggestions for how to be more sensitive, to help my friends feel like they dont have defend themselves just because i have made different choices than they have.

How would you feel about your man making cheating jokes with a history of cheating.,"Boyfriend and I planned to move in together one day, that day is coming up sometime this or next year. Had LOTs of ups and downs in the last five years which included cheating on both ends but that was early in the relationship and dealt with and mostly over it. He supposedly is about to come up on big money over growing weed(which I do not hate in itself but not an ideal job imo just for the fact it’s weed, smoke it but I don’t want him to make it his job. He already dabs every day and a lot on his days off and I ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HATE IT. Makes me feel like he just keeps wanting to zone me out or something). So anyways, I am worried about him working with those stereotypical weed girls and if they smoke together(which to me seems inappropriate if in a relationship, why would  you spend time getting high with someone of the opposite sex alone). And I know those girls are his type and I don’t smoke anymore, I rarely even drink now, I simply grew out of it. So from worrying about the money going to his head working with a bunch of girls that smoke weed or him making jokes about having a “soprano relationship” like his Chris and Adrianna or Tony and Carmella like??? It was funny the first time stfu now. I try to not think about it but he keeps talking about how all this money is gonna come about and he makes those stupid jokes, but he denies wanting an open relationship. I’m considering leaving him or just finding a side piece if I find out he does and maybe it’s best to keep secret? Like we both live our lives together happy but have that outside of it? What would you do, I know I sound insecure and untrusting but just from the shit I have dealt with back then to this shit he’s saying now, I don’t wanna leave him after all these years but it’s harping on my mental health. Not sure what route to take. Stick it out and wait or just leave now.",1,"How would you feel about your man making cheating jokes with a history of cheating.Boyfriend and I planned to move in together one day, that day is coming up sometime this or next year.

Prenup the second time,"My partner and I are trying to work out the details of a prenup - it's his second marriage and my first. We have a child together. He says everything that's his will remain his; neither will stake a claim to the other's money/assets/retirement funds etc and that during the marriage, we keep our assets and finances separate. Any shared assets post wedding will be divided according to the percentage each partner has put into it - meaning if he puts 80% and I put 20%, I only get back 20% irrespective of the number of years we are married. I think his prenup will be extremely unfair to me especially if we're married for a long time and the relationship crumbles. He earns 8X more than I do and thinks an even split is unrealistic. Sure, but diving up the assets based on who put in what percentage of money is unrealistic too. So, what's the middle ground? Have any of you here encountered a similar situation?

Bra unhooked while sleeping and I sleep alone?,"Just woke up at 3:20 am here in the UK due to some noise, and have noticed that my bra (yes I sleep with it on) was unhooked! 

I’m single, live at home and sleep alone and no one has been in my room. I’m quite baffled and scared in how the fuck this happened, since it’s one of those 2 hook bras where even I struggle hooking on. 

This has never happened to me in my life! It has never randomly unhooked during my sleep ! 

I’m a little shook because yesterday, for the first time in my life, I orgasmed in real life over a sexual dream. That was strange for me too, but that and what happened earlier creeped me the hell out!

I need to leave this time before he comes back. [DV],"Hey I need someone to tell me what to do or let me know what they have done . I barely trust my own thoughts anymore .

It's been a terrible ride and lately I know the more I stay the more I make sense of this horrible relationship. He doesn't even acknowledge our son anymore. What should I do? Do you know anyone who stayed in a shelter before? How was it like?  Before he left he told me how he didn't want to hit me in front our son but I made him do it. I may sound like a complete idiot but I just need  someone to look past the judgement and help me figure out what I should do next. I was raised in a very abusive home and he wasn't the first person to hit me. I'm not violent and I want to cycle to end at me and my son.

What to ask for in a prenup,"My partner and I have been together for several years and have a child. We've thinking about getting married - this will be his second marriage and my first - and he wants us to sign a prenup. He has children from his first marriage and significant assets and inheritance that he wants to protect. He wants the agreement to state that each of us waive any right to spousal support, alimony, pension, life insurance and such. He also wants the agreement to state that any income and property each of us earns or buys in the future be separate and the other not stake a claim to it. While I have no problem with him keeping what's his coming into the marriage, I feel like it's unfair to me to keep everything separate while we are married, particularly if we stay together for years and then divorce.

For some background, we're in mid/late 40s, he earns at least 5x more than I do and we live in a house that he owns. He is a citizen while I have a residency sponsored by my employer. We currently manage our finances separately and while he pays for the utilities, I pay for everything else - schooling, child care, groceries and all other household related expenses. I contribute as much as I can - almost everything I earn goes for the above and as a consequence, I don't have much money to save at the end of the month. I have no debt, some savings in 401k and an $10k emergency fund , but not much else. I will inherit my parent's house, but that is in my home country. Assuming I continue to contribute at this rate, I will not have much more in terms of savings several years from now. I also had to take a significantly lower paying job when I moved to be with him. 

My concern about his prenup agreement is that it will lock me in. Even if we decide to jointly buy assets together (which I cannot currently afford), he thinks it should be split based on how much each of us put in, irrespective of the number of years we are together as husband and wife. While I think this is unfair, I am not exactly clear on what ""fair"" constitutes. I feel that it doesn't take into consideration that this is supposed to be a partnership and that I might have to take a pay hit because his career is more important than mine. I will not stake a claim on what belongs to his children and do not expect a 50:50 split - not even close. But at the same time, I feel that if we are together for a long time, he should have some consideration for what I am left with. If he decides to divorce me 10 years from now, I will have to more or less start from scratch.

Can any of you ladies give some advise on this?

Your newsfeed is by default everyone but you can change it to a friends only feed. 

We believe in freedom of speech unlike Facebook.

We have a system that rewards you for being active and once you earned enough points you can redeem them for gift cards. 

Our outside looks like our inside so when you visit the site it’s like you’re already logged in.

Looking for advice or experience about prenup clauses,"I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this question in. My partner and I have been together for several years and have a child. We've thinking about getting married - this will be his second marriage and my first - and he wants us to sign a prenup. He has children from his first marriage and significant assets and inheritance that he wants to protect. He wants the agreement to state that each of us waive any right to spousal support, alimony, pension, life insurance and such. He also wants the agreement to state that any income and property each of us earns or buys in the future be separate and the other not stake a claim to it. While I have no problem with him keeping what's his coming into the marriage, I feel like it's unfair to me to keep everything separate while we are married, particularly if we stay together for years and then divorce.

For some background, we're in mid/late 40s, he earns 5x more than I do and we live in a house that he owns. He is a citizen while I have a residency sponsored by my employer. We currently manage our finances separately and while he pays for the utilities, I pay for everything else - schooling, child care, groceries and all other household related expenses. I contribute as much as I can - almost everything I earn goes for the above and as a consequence, I don't have much money to save at the end of the month. I have no debt, some savings in 401k and an $10k emergency fund , but not much else. I will inherit my parent's house, but that is in my home country. Assuming I continue to contribute at this rate, I will not have much more in terms of savings several years from now.

My concern about his prenup agreement is that it will lock me in. Even if we decide to jointly buy assets together (which I cannot currently afford), he thinks it should be split based on how much each of us put in, irrespective of the number of years we are together as husband and wife. While I think this is unfair, I am not exactly clear on what ""fair"" constitutes. I feel that it doesn't take into consideration that this is supposed to be a partnership. I am an independent, self-made woman, but I am also very much aware that this might change as I age. I will not stake a claim on what belongs to his children and do not expect a 50:50 split - not even close. But at the same time, I feel that if we are together for a long time, he should have some consideration for what I am left with. If he decides to divorce me 10 years from now, I will have to more or less start from scratch.

Can any of you ladies give some advice on this? I would like to propose some clauses, but unsure what they should be.",1,"Looking for advice or experience about prenup clausesI am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this question in.

I accidentally found some evidence of infidelity. How should I handle this?,"I opened up a shared laptop, went to reddit and thought I was signed in on my account, but was in fact on my wife's.

These messages are dated 2 years ago. About 1 year into our marriage.

Perhaps it was a one time thing of the past, but it's something I feel weird about which means I need to bring it up.

I am in love with a girl who lives in another city but very cloce from my hometown,about 45 min with car.Her hometown is the same with me,but she will live at that city for 2 years because she must have practise-job there from university.

We had a good relationship for about one month,but without having sex,because our meetings during werent more than 3 hours..She was coming every weekend and everything was nice.First time i felt little strange was when i visited the city she lives now for 3 days,i was living at my friend because she never invited me at her home,and 3 days we never meet eachother...

We have done both the mistake to communicate with whats up,messenger etc with messages and not so much with phone calls..

Our last meeting was when we had one month anniversary,was nice,gifts,kisses,hugs etc but again she wanted to go at home after 2-3 hours and my mistake was that i didnt tell her that i wanna go together at my home for having sex and i respected that she was tired...

After that started to be different with me at messages,i felt it,she started answers very typical messages without the love feelling,and she didnt came for 2 weeks...never answering my calls...I asked her whats going on,and she answered me that our relationship is not like she wanted and she wants some time to think...Never answered my calls,only messages and when i asked her at least a last meeting she answered me that she doesnt know  what she wants...

I gave her time,didnt communicate with her for some time until New Year's eve when i sent her happy new year my love as message because she was not answering my call....She answered me,we started a chat and she was describing me like she was describing another man,everything she was telling for me wasnt me...She was telling that i dont take initiatives and i am idle and she cant be with man like that .....I told her that she has mistake,i am not that type of man,we both did mistakes,now we know them and we can make a restart...She said its better to stop it now ...

Is my vagina a normal size?,"I'm a 23yo female who hasn't given birth... I've been looking everywhere for info on the dimensions of the average vagina but I'm seeing so much mixed info. 

When I'm not aroused I can insert one finger into my vagina I can especially feel the top and bottom but I can barely feel the sides... when I insert two, my fingers just barely touch the sides while the top and bottom are still felt very strongly. When I insert three fingers straight across, I can feel some pressure on the sides and though it's pretty difficult to maintain the position, it is barely possible for them to fit that way. Is this normal? Should my fingers instead be in full contact with the sides of my vagina? Am I loose?

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

I have gotten wounds around the left side of my labia. I am talking the size of golfballs. The skin is completely removed and it is just redish and liquid is coming out of it.

It hurts so bad that I can barely walk or move. Every step feels like a knife. And since I also gotta shower it is hard to let it heal on its on.

What should I (22M) do about my girlfriend's (25F) guy-friend who's in love with her and kinda obsessed?," There's that my girlfriend's guyfriend who's in love with her. I never really bothered about that. I always trusted my girlfriend and her love for me and that she picked me even when she knew his love. And she never really had feelings for him and never saw him as more than a friend. Till that day when she told me about the time they sexted. she told me when she was dissociated and talking some random shit. I was angry about that but I let it go as it happened 4 or 5 years ago and even then she didn't have feelings for him and nothing happened in real life like they never kissed or even hold hands. And I didn't really wanna be possessive and controlling as I'm not that kind of guy. I forgot about that. They didn't talk that much. They barely met. Away from our relationship, he used to stress her by stalking her and forcing conversations even when she blocked him he tried to talk on another application or another way even emailed her. She didn't wanna end their ""friendship"" as she didn't wanna lose him and he's been around for a while and he didn't have a lot of friends and that he's depressed and shit. I didn't really bother all of that as she's an adult and mature enough to make her own decisions and I shouldn't tell her what to do and what not to do. All I did was advise her and give my opinion when she asked for it and it was that she should end this friendship with closure as I didn't like him putting pressure on her and for the sake of everyone as he is hurting too waiting for her love and care so it's not healthy anymore and she's not just a friend for him even when he says that he's not waiting for anything but we all knew that he's waiting for her. It was just my advice not really more and not an order. Up until the day she met him without telling me. Not only that but she also lied to me about it and also sent a picture of her meal showing that she's alone but she wasn't. I knew she was lying. I got my hands on some proof. When I asked her more than once at different times whether she heard anything from him this Christmas she denied anything but she didn't know that I already knew. When I confronted her that I know they met with the proof she couldn't deny it. I got so angry we almost broke up and I already made the decision. She kept crying and asking me not to leave her and that she was afraid and kept swearing that she was going to tell me. I was hurt. But I forgave her because I love her and I know she loves me but she made a mistake and I won't lose much by giving her another chance with making it clear it's gonna be her last chance and it can't happen again. I won't let it. When I asked her why she was afraid of telling me and if she didn't feel safe around me and if she thought I was judgmental, she said no, she feels safe and thinks that I'm not judgmental but she just needed some time. Now a problem happened because of him and we almost broke up. I know she's the one who lied to me but because she was afraid to tell me about meeting him. He asked to see her, and she didn't wanna let him down at the entrance of the new year. Plus she tried to commit suicide a while ago and that's a reason she met him she said and kind of goodbye in case she tries to do that again. But I can't really stand him anymore. Maybe we can make sure that this won't happen again by ending this friendship. I think I can ask her to do that now and she will do it. But should I do it? Or should I let her take the decision herself (knowing that if I leave it to her, she won't be able to do that)?

I am an absolute wreck because of my STD,"Obligatory throw away.  Also a brief disclaimer: yes i immediately went to a doctor, and am getting treatment. This is more emotional, I guess?

I'll keep it short. My bf and I dated a year, We broke up for 1 month. Got back together, and have been together since. During that time I didn't sleep or do anything sexual with anyone. He did with two people. (we're 23 and 24). A few months after we got back together I noticed a small bump on my upper labia. I tell him. Go to the doctor. She's like ""Okay so this is definitely genital warts"". I cry, a lot. I've never had warts and he hasn't shown symptoms. He cries and feels awful that he may have done this. That one (was) is only the one and it's stubborn. Today I noticed I have one near my tailbone in my butt crack.

I've been crying ever since. I feel so so *dirty.* I feel like this isn't my body. I have no one to talk to about this and in 3 weeks it's 8 years since my mom died. I have no female relatives to talk to about this. There's a gigantic lump in my throat, im shaking, and i feel my heart pounding. If a friend told me this thing happened, I'd support and love them and give the rational facts (a lot of people have it, etc) but that doesnt't work on myself....I dont know. Does this make sense? Is this normal?

Ghosted on the day of a date - what could have happened?,"21M here. Recently connected with a girl from high school via Instagram that I had crushes on a couple years ago. Hadn’t expected anything to come of it but SHE gave me her number after talking on IG for an hour and then we texted for another hour. It was going great so I asked if she wanted to go out. Immediately she said for sure and provided me with times that worked. I chose one and she said that sounded great. We chose a day that was only one day away so I didn’t text her the next day (normal etiquette once the date is established) and then the afternoon of the date I shot her a quick text seeing if our plans were still good for the night. She doesn’t respond all day. I go to the place anyways just in case she lost her phone or something and of course she doesn’t show. I actually call her after the date was supposed to start and she doesn’t pick up.

This morning I sent her another text telling her I’m not upset at all and totally understand if something came up and just wanna make sure she’s okay. Still nothing.

What could possibly make a woman change her mind in 1 day when she was totally down and nothing changed? I’m seriously baffled and hurt rn.

Tl;dr - Made concrete plans for a date which was confirmed by a woman. Then she ghosted me the day of our day which was only one day later. What could possibly have made her go from excited to ghosting when nothing happened between the plans and the date?",1,"Ghosted on the day of a date - what could have happened?21M here.

Is it acceptable to quit a job via email?,"I’m wondering if its alright or not to quit a job via email? I recently got a new job and I start in over a week. The job I’m currently at has a policy rule, that if you quit and don’t have a job lined up, you are able to finish out a 2 weeks. But if you are quitting and do have a job lined up, you are not able to finish a two weeks and you have to be done immediately. So in my case, I unfortunately cannot give them the benefit of a 2 week notice and just have to straight up quit. I’m wondering the best way to just straight up quit, for my situation. A recent co worker who quit, quit via email and thought it was appropriate as she was able to communicate her feelings without being talked over and interrupted. The other most recent co worker who quit and tried putting in a 2 weeks( she lied and said she didn’t have a new job even though she did, just so she could help the company out) only made it 2 days in of the 2 week notice, until my boss cornered her in the break room, basically harassing her about quitting, starting a screaming fight and making my co worker cry and end up walking out for good. With past jobs, I have always put in a two weeks face to face with respectable managers, and I’m grateful for that as I’ve kept good friends from it and no burned bridges. But with this company, I’m scared as fuck lol! I just have bad anxiety as it is, &amp; I’m nervous quitting in person isnt going to end well, &amp; i don’t know what to do in those situations lol.

Has anyone tried the curly method for 2b hair?,I just recently figured out my hair type and i want to treat it correctly.

My hair is fine so alotta products weigh it down or make it greasy/crunchy. I do have a LOT of hair though. I just started looking into the curly girl method and i wanna make sure its legit before i spend the money.  So if youve tried it for 2b hair did it work and was it worth the money?

How do I get rid of BABY FEVER?,"I had a dream a couple nights ago that I (22F) had a small child, maybe a year or two old. She was beautiful. I can’t shake the dream.. now I desperately want a baby. However, I’m getting married in October, and I’d like to buy a house before getting pregnant. I keep reminding myself of these goals, and I’m not going to get pregnant and risk those goals.. but I can’t shake this incessant NEED to have a baby. Everything about it, even the pain of delivery and the tantrums and the sleepless nights, sounds so romanticized and beautiful to me. What do I do?

Am I moving to fast??,"So I was in a 3 year relationship where my partner emotional cheated on me. She wasn’t happy in our relationship bc I was neglecting her feelings. Being honest, I was completely depressed and couldn’t mentally be there for her, I would zone out most of the time she needed me. This lead to her emotional cheating on me resulted in us breaking up. Soon after we broke up she ended up hooking up with the person she emotional cheated on my with.  

That was the worst feeling ever, soon after I tried everything I can do to win her back but I eventually accepted the fact that our relationship will never be the same and I have to focus on myself becoming a person and forgiving her for the emotional cheating part. A month after everything unfold UNINTENTIONALLY I met someone I really like. Like ALOT ALOT. I’m very scared bc I usually don’t start liking other ppl so soon after a breakup, especially a BAD break up. When I’m with that new person I’m legit really happy, not trying to compare to my recent ex but everything I hated about my ex, the new person is the complete opposite.

She just got out of a long distance relationship around the same time I got out my relationship.

Is my ex (m26) trying to get me (f22) back?,"We broke up mutually and amicably over four months ago, we haven't seen each other since as I moved away but have been texting and have called once. I should also mention that for around 3 months we were completely no contact, which has helped me move on and see that, though I love him as a friend, I don't want to be with him anymore.

From his messages I'm not sure if he's just being a helpful friend or if he has other intentions - I'll give a few examples... he has mentioned a few times that he misses spending time with me and sometimes wishes I hadn't moved away. He hasn't overtly said he wants to get back together but some small things make me worry that he might, such as sending me a song that reminds him of me and just generally seeming pretty keen to message me.

I'm moving back to his city next week and he has expressed interest in seeing me pretty soon after I get back, as well as helping me move into my new place. Does it seem like he has hidden intentions or has just genuinely missed me and want to pursue a friendship? Is it a good idea to see him when I get back?",1,"Is my ex (m26) trying to get me (f22) back?We broke up mutually and amicably over four months ago, we haven't seen each other since as I moved away but have been texting and have called once.

Should I wax for the first time?!,"I (22f) have never had any kind of wax before!! I’ve thought about waxing down there but have never done anything other than just think about it. Shaving it causes too much pain afterwards (razor bumps And itchiness). Lately, I have been using my boyfriends electric razor and it works miracles since it does not actually shave the hair off! 

I’ve been thinking about getting an actual wax since the hair closer to my bottom is hard to reach with the electric razor. I also have been a little self conscious in shorts since they are short shorts and I have to be careful to keep everything covered. Sometimes I get folliculitis but do have a tropical cream from my doctor.

Sooo, should I make an appointment for Tuesday right before I leave to go to grad school?

FAQ Q&amp;A: What is your unpopular opinion?,"Hello, AskWomen!

We have steadily been updating our sub's FAQ to include a great many topics that have lately been coming up with high frequency (and repetitive answers).  New FAQ Q&amp;A threads will continue to go up roughly twice a week until the list is finished.

In case you missed them, the most recent FAQ Q&amp;A threads before this were:


* [How much makeup do you wear, and why do you wear it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8vs8cn/faq_qa_how_much_makeup_do_you_wear_and_why_do_you/)

* [What small details of a potential SO's apartment make a big difference to your impression of them?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8woz07/faq_qa_what_small_details_of_a_potential_sos/)

* [What has been your experience with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and what have been the most useful methods of handling your symptoms?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8xqd36/faq_qa_what_has_been_your_experience_with/)

* [How do you feel about long hair on men/short hair on women?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8ymijz/faq_qa_how_do_you_feel_about_long_hair_on/)

* [What do you think is the most attractive method for dealing with baldness](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8zz9ud/faq_qa_what_do_you_think_is_the_most_attractive/)

These threads will be **HEAVILY MODERATED.** The point is to create an informative repository of answers for questions that get over-asked on the sub, and while AskWomen has never been a debate sub, the No Derailment rule will be applied particularly strictly in these threads in order to make them as densely relevant to the topic as possible. If you want to have an in-depth conversation about someone's answer, take it to PMs.

Today's question is: **What is your unpopular opinion?**

A special note on this topic.  This is a question we have submitted *incredibly* frequently, and it is one of the most difficult to moderate as well, because well... people wanna fight.  While arguments/disagreements are not something this subreddit moderates for, and there are many healthy discussions from opposite points of view on this sub, all too frequently these conversations end up resulting in rule-breaking behavior like invalidation, derailing, personal attacks, and disrespectful commentary. While like all other topics, we will still moderate for all of our rules (including racism, homophobia, transphobia, and gendered slurs).

That being said, we are going to do something a bit different with this post, is that when this thread is taken down from the announcements, only the top level comments will remain.  If you respond to a commentator to discuss their unpopular opinion, it and any comments related will be removed down the chain.  If you want your opinion to be included in the topic to do so, you will need to make sure your comment is a top-level comment, that answers the question asked, and does not derail the topic to discuss something unrelated (like someone else's answer).

  The purposes of these FAQ's are to collect the answers to frequently asked questions, and part of the design of this subreddit is to create an easily searchable (for reddit at least) forum to see the various answers, opinions, and experiences of this community.  So for the purpose of this topic please limit your comments to top level comments, if you wish to discuss moderation please [click here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskWomen&amp;subject=Why+was+this+removed?&amp;message=\[My+comment\]\(https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/92gypf/-/e35nt9k/\)+was+removed+and+I+do+not+understand+the+reason+given+by+the+mod+who+acted upon+it.).

What is the probability of the average woman avoiding sexual assault if she fights back?,"Not trying to victim-blame, but the more I read on the male strength, the more horrified I get at the prospect of being a woman. It's awful knowing that you are powerless against half of the population, and considering I already get nauseous by stories of women getting raped while being paralyzed with fear (but tbh, they don't make me feel as weak) getting raped while being unable to do anything about it would make me more disturbed. Sure, I know it's a rarity, and most rapes are date-rapes, but that doesn't make me feel less shitty (doesn't help that I can't exercise without the chances of my aorta tearing open.)

So, how much is the probability of the average woman avoiding getting raped by an average man if she tries to fight back? "

"29, M - I’m poor, should I wait until I have more money before I try to date?","I don’t have much money because I work part time and study part time.  

I put a lot of things off in my 20s because of shyness, depression, laziness, fear, avoidance, and a lack of direction. I wasted a lot of time, and I’m making up
for it now by studying to get a comfortable job.

I think there’s an expectation that people in their late 20s should have a career and money. If that’s true, then I’m not meeting it and am probably pretty undesirable.

I’m also learning that the older you get, the harder it is to meet new people, including women. A lot of my peers are in serious relationships, and planning to have / or have children. They’re also getting married and becoming more insular.

I’ve been using Tinder to try to find a girlfriend, but because I’m poor and work part time, I think I turn most women off.

I’m  wondering, is it worth trying to find a girlfriend at this time? 

Maybe I should wait 1-2 years time when I’ll have a full time job and  solid income.

I’d like to try to find a girlfriend because I’ve been single for many years and basically, I’m feeling alone. I’m getting older, uglier, and more bitter about being single.

I had planned to take one day at night as I worked out when to take them again.  As this very early morning approach, I felt cramps and stuff. I checked if my menstruation cycle has started, and no. But two hours later I felt it definitely has. And of course it did....
As soon I realized it has started I went to take a pill. I don't know how effective this would be but I need to take one today regardless. 
So how long would it take for my hormones in my body  to react to the pills  in order to signal /delay  not to shed blood??? As to how many hours do I have to wait so that it stops?
I would like to know because I don't want to sit in a car for 6hrs with my period. My family  may not smell it but I can, it is not very pleasant since I had to sit through  that during one of my final exams; smelling like pile of dead bloody rotten fish.

I.e. dad brings home the bacon, mom watches the kids and does the housekeeping. Nothing wrong with it imo, just a decision my parents made with dividing responsibilities.

We both recently moved back to the area and were chatting.  She suggested we meet up for a drink.  I asked for her number and she gave it too me and said she was busy this past weekend.  I saved her number but didn’t say anything back. This was last Friday.  Today I was going to text her but noticed she unmatched me.  It’s been a few days.  Would you find it wierd if I still texted or should I just move on?  Usually I would just move on but she’s totally my type and I feel like we’d really get along.,1,Should I still text her?Hi women of reddit!   So I matched with a girl on bumble.

"24, single, lost in career and life decisions and ""dreams"". How did you pick between career paths and friends and family and boys?","Please bear with my rant, thank you. 

24, been single for a year. I used to be smart intellectual girl, busy in school, never socialized or partied, and planned to do masters and MBAs and overall just career oriented. But I had a bit of a quarter life crisis where I questioned and got very anxious with all my life decisions.  I felt very lost and got depressed. My self-esteem lowered because I thought if I was really smart, why did I not have it all figured out just yet. 

I did a short term internship that introduced me to the highs of life. I made so many new friends, went out lots, drank a lot, partied, met a guy and we fell ""madly in love"" with each other. I was so happy, I didn't feel depressed anymore. I always had doubts about this guy, but he seemed to be genuinely into me and wanted our relationship to continue, even go long distance for a bit. I used to think about doing a masters after uni, but I basically gave up on that because I realized I liked where I was, and if and when this guy came back, my life would be complete. There were other issues too. My family hated what I had turned into (they are extremely traditional and conservative). They did not know that I drank and did not let me party. And they would've definitely not liked my bf (I never told them about him). Fast forward this guy turns out to be a liar and absolutely crushes my heart within a week of moving away, stating he lost interest and will to make any effort and that we are ""incompatible"" all of a sudden. Honestly, he an immature and childish a$$, but I was too blind and naive to see it then. Maybe that was what he meant by ""incompatible""...
So a year's gone, I am more or less over him, hate him, but mostly hate myself for being such a fool. I was heartbroken so at uni I succumbed to partying and ignored figuring out my career. I was struggling but I couldn't tell my family anything for fear of judgement. It made us all very distant. 
I am now looking to get jobs in my city, and I realize this is not what I wanted with myself. I always wanted to move away, work in another career field. But masters programs all start a year later, and I still don't know what to do and where exactly to go. If I get a well paying job in my city, I might never leave because of the pay and opportunity (which is rare now), and because it is a very different field to what I want to do so it would be a dramatic change. I also then worry what life will be like in another city, will I even be happy in a new place without any friends or family. Am I making a good choice or just trying to look for a change? All the worries get to me. And then I worry about the fact that I will be 25, 26, 27 and single. I worry I will not find a man and waste the ""youthful"" years of my life studying...I do sound crazy now right? I know no other way of finding a man other than tinder or bumble, and I honestly find it rather depressing.
So I realize this: I don't exactly have career goals, I struggle at making life altering decisions, I am having issues with my family, leaving the comfort of my close girlfriends makes me uncomfortable, I think a man will make my life complete and I will alter my life goals for him (because I realize I actually have none...). And I compare myself to the girls who ""have it together"" with their jobs and long and strong relationships. I think I should do what they do, be like them. If I find someone and I want to move, what if he doesn't. Also my family doesn't approve of the type of guys I am interested in, so I feel like I am in a bind in all ways.

Proposed. She said she'll think about it.,"I asked my best friend of 10 years to marry me last night. 

So here’s a little backstory. 

I’m 32 she’s 28. I grew up with a negative view of marriage because all the married couples I saw growing up resented their partners. My dad married my mom cause she was pregnant with me then they got divorced immediately cause he cheated on her. My paternal Grandparents slept in separate rooms. My maternal grandfather was abusive and my grandma had to leave him. I have met strangers who are seemingly in happy marriages... men who say they love their wives more than anything else but caution me about getting married. So in summation that is why I always had a negative perception of marriage. 

She was raised in a conservative Christian family. Grandparents stayed married. Parents stayed married. Both happily. She’s always wanted marriage and children and I thought, until recently, I didn’t. 

For a decade we’ve had a open relationship, a relationship in which we were and still are intimate but sometimes dated other people. It was not traditional at all but we always loved to be around each other more than anyone else. I don’t want to live without this woman. My experiences shaped my perception about marriage and children but yesterday I decided to challenge and/or let go of all I know and propose to her. 

I asked her parents, whom said they consider me like a son but they said they would rather her marry a Christian than me.

I asked her and she cried (from the shock I think), asked if I was manic and then said she has to think about it. She’s now asking her friends and family which isn’t boding well for me because her family wants her to marry a Christian and some of her long time friends don’t like me, one in particular is a very judgmental religious person.

I want to make this clear, I’m not absolving myself of any of the pain and confusion she felt and is feeling. I treated her like a queen for the past decade but I made it clear to her and everyone else I didn’t want to get married and have children. I def gave her bricks to build those walls so her heart could survive being around me, I own that. And I can’t explain what changed besides me just now realizing I want to see her everyday for the rest of my life.

"How do you shut down a friendly guy online whose pushing your boundaries when you're ""too nice"" yourself?","So pretty simple.

I've gained some online success (paid tyvm) and now I'm finding some people will talk to me for a while and be great conversation and then slowly start pushing it into flirting. (Assume my genre is ""Cooking"", so people will message me asking all kinds of things).

Instead of the cliche DM sliders who straight-up hit on me. I find these guys are trying to build something with me. It makes me very very uncomfortable, deceived and very wary of talking to anyone who DM's me and I don't want to do that because I want to network and connect with my followers you know? I get why they do it - I'm objectively pretty and my platform is very positive. I'm like sugar to bees. (Not trying to sound arrogant but it is what it is).

I'm 1) not interested 2) in a relationship but that shouldn't matter and 3) I can't be mean/firm.

I don't know how to address things like 

""Will you follow me too""

or

""maybe we can chat on the phone sometime down the line""

like btfo, I'm just here to talk about pasta.

"For those of you familiar with the Harry Potter series who would you choose, James Potter or Severus Snape?","Spoilers for those who haven't read it. 

Severus Snape was the childhood friend of Lily Evans. Severus Snape was a bit of an outcast and loner. When they both entered Hogwarts they encountered James Potter who relentlessly bullied Severus Snape and made his life hell. James was also popular at school.

While at Hogwarts Severus and Lily drifted apart and Severus fell in with the wrong crowd. Their friendship ended when Severus called Lily an offensive slur. Lily eventually married James when he apparently reformed and stopped being an asshole.

Lily and James eventually died and it was shown that Severus was deeply in love with Lily the whole time.

I've been bulking for the past few months with a lot of squats, and my ass is now a tad ridiculous.

My body is still proportional, my torso is V shaped so even my mid-back is wider than my ass.

Like, when I put on my trousers, there's a small gap between the waistband and my body, but at the back the waistband droops like a V because of how my butt sticks out a bit. 

I've always had a more prominent booty than most. Even when I was lighter. So how do you ladies feel about juicy, meaty, bubble butts that jiggle like the sea during a hurricane? Turn off? Turn on?

"Women who have PMDD, how do you deal?!","I know one of the most effective treatments for [PMDD](https://www.webmd.com/women/pms/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder#1) is anti-depressants (SSRI's) which basically reinforce the happy chemicals in your brain and calm you down. My drug is Prozac. I always thought it was only semi-effective; not taking care of all the symptoms, but making a difference. I also have [Bipolar Disorder](https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-1-disorder#1) so I take a mood stabilizer as well.

Last week I ran out of Prozac for 5 days, about 10 days before my period was due to start. **OH. MY. GAWD.** I woke up and my body felt like it got hit by a bus. I'm like WTF it must be all this humidity. Yeah, no. Still sore, no more humidity. 

I quickly became the Wicked Bipolar Bitch of the Midwest. When people asked for my help, I would just straight up say ""No."" I literally picked fights with my fiance (not like me AT ALL). I grew a Buddha-belly of bloat. I sobbed every single night. I even cried at work. I was on edge about literally anything that would cause me the least bit of stress. And I was so SO tired all the time.

I am now back on the Prozac, but it has to build back up in my system and this will take about a week. I am still experiencing these awful symptoms. I need some *serious* advice. Haaalp please.

Boyfriend[27m] is flirting with his hairdresser,"My \[27f \] boyfriend \[27m\] drives 20 minutes one way to see a girl that cuts his hair down every couple months. She has been cutting his hair for years and they are from the same small town. I went with him few times, and their interaction looks is incredibly intimate.  They talk non stop, he makes her giggle, her tits are in his face for good 15 minutes while she is rubbing my mans face ""trimming his beard"", they whisper and make long eye contacts. After they are done, I find out that on top of that he tips her 50% for ""the service"".

Little bit of background on our relationship. Been together 2 years, small bumps  and bruises along the way but we're in a pretty good place right now. We almost broke up couple times, because he has gotten way too close to his female friend to the point where they were talking via text all the time, he would go meet them without me and received nudes from them. When I found the nudes, I gave him an ultimatum, and he chose me. We have gotten over it now, but when I see the interaction that I have described above, it kind of triggers all the old memories and seriously upsets me.

Also he always complains how broke he is or about to be, then we split everything even the tiniest of the bills, i.e 10 dollar coffee shop bill, hence the the 50% tip is outrageous.

I spoke to him about this last night, and he called me overly jealous and crazy and suggested Id see a therapist. Reading above, do you think I am overreacting and acting crazy?

I (23m) feel extremely guilty because I want break up with my very insecure GF (21),"A little bit of backstory, she was a virgin before meeting me, she had been cheated on before and found her ex in bed with another girl, this severely traumatized her. We have been together for 1 year and I bought her a ring and a bracelet that she really wanted for our anniversary (I hate anniversaries and think they’re bullshit but she thought they were special). 

We’ve had a very rocky half year, due to her being extremely jealous to the point of fighting almost every other week because she was either mad I went out with my friends instead of her or she saw that I looked at a celebrity model’s instagram page and stuff like that, on top of me having a lot of stress at work and struggling with a little bit of depression some weeks.

She is such a caring and sweet person, she loves animals, and would take a hurt pigeon off the street and to the vet. She does everything she can for me, if I feel bad she comes right away. I think the constant fighting over stupid small things like me going out with my friends for once or me not being able to go over to her’s because I worked 12 hrs straight and wanted to go home and chill by myself have really dwindled my feelings for her and even made me resent her at some point. I don’t even feel like having sex with her but I can’t tell if this is because I’m too stressed or she just doesn’t do it for me anymore (not physically, I just can’t get horny because I feel like I have some resentment towards her).

When she’s on her period or feeling bad, she expects me to be there for her 24/7 and even when she’s not, we have to be talking almost all the time because she has no job and school is out for her so she stays home pretty much all the time.

A week ago, I didn’t sleep well and I had a terribly stressful workday with multiple very long meetings that I had to direct, and I am a little bit of an anxious person so that was super hard for me, she was feeling bad and invited me to take a walk (keep in mind her house is 30 min away and I don’t have a car), so I went and hung out for about 3 hours until I was completely exhausted. We had a good time, laughing and stuff all the way. Then, tomorrow comes, she says she’s feeling bad again but I couldn’t go because I needed some time alone/with a friend who lives right next to me (guy) and I went over to his house and just played video games and chilled, she got really mad and threatened me with ending it (not the first time), this has happened at least a hundred times in the past year.

She is madly in love with me, she’s had some pretty fucked up experiences and traumas, and she is kind of an introvert like me who was bullied as a kid, but her self confidence is so shitty that no matter what I do or say I can’t help it.

It’s eating me up inside that I have lost my feelings for her and I have to break her heart and I’m scared how she’ll take it, I literally am struggling to breathe because of how shit I feel.

Any advice is appreciated",1,"I (23m) feel extremely guilty because I want break up with my very insecure GF (21)A little bit of backstory, she was a virgin before meeting me, she had been cheated on before and found her ex in bed with another girl, this severely traumatized her.

I didn't want to include nipple coverage or exposure since that doesn't apply specifically to wearing or not wearing a bra.

Difficult coworker? What can I do to make it better?,"I work with a small group of women in a large firm. One of my colleagues is difficult to work with most days and some days she’s amazing. I’ve been here just over a year and I’m always making sure I follow all rules and policies to the best of my capabilities. When I have questions I always ask (no matter how stupid or small they may be). I find that when I follow her instructions to a T there is always something that changes with the instructions after I’ve done the work and presented a draft of the work to her. 

When she reviews the work she’s quick to cut me down and tell me I’m doing it all wrong even though I’ve done it exactly how she wants it done. I’ve pointed it out to her before and have asked her if I’ve done something wrong to make her upset and it’s caused some backlash so I don’t say anything anymore and just do what I’m told and deal with the negative comments from her after.

"Dear Women of Reddit, have you ever rejected a man if he DIDN'T try to sleep with you early in the dating process?","My entire adult life I've taken poor dating advice, in addition to being immature, where I was of the mind that I have to try to bed a woman on the first few dates in order to win her heart. While this approach has gotten me quite a few one night stands and a failed relationship, I haven't been able to find anything meaningful.

The past few years I have been working on myself, to be a better man and to figure out what I want. I decided that above all, I want a meaningful relationship with a beautiful woman with a beautiful personality. I recently was dating a girl who posesses all the qualities that I look for. She is kind, sweet, affectionate, intelligent and has her own life and dreams. I wanted to do things the right way, and so I did my very best to court her properly. While I never pushed for sex or invite her over to my place, we were very romantic and affectionate with each other from the beginning, and I was very clear with my intentions. The three dates we shared were amazing, and I was hopeful that this was going to work out.

As of late however, she has been unresponsive to my date requests, although she hasn't completely disappeared on me. I'm assuming she is no longer interested in seeing me. Due to some deep seated issues that I have dealt with since childhood, I have always been harshly critical of myself. Because of this, I have been second guessing myself and thinking I messed something up along the way. The big thing that I keep replaying in my mind is whether or not I wasn't properly reading her signals and that maybe she wanted to have sex with me and expected me to initiate it.

 I know that there is no way I can no for sure what happened, and I know I need to be nicer to myself and give myself more credit for trying to be better, but it would help to have some insight here from other women on what is expected of a man in the dating process. Every google search I do tells me that I didn't do anything wrong, but some additional clarity couldn't hurt. Thanks in advance for any insight and reading my story.",1,"Dear Women of Reddit, have you ever rejected a man if he DIDN'T try to sleep with you early in the dating process?My entire adult life I've taken poor dating advice, in addition to being immature, where I was of the mind that I have to try to bed a woman on the first few dates in order to win her heart.

Are dimples on a guy attractive?,This is gonna sound strange but I’ve never really noticed that I had dimples. In all honesty I don’t smile a lot unless I’ve had a few drinks in or if I’m just pulling a smile during a conversation to be polite. Just started working at a Tesco’s (supermarket) and the girl (around my age) who was kinda guiding me through thought they were ‘cute’. Also remember hearing the same thing from a 2nd year student giving a mini tour when I had an interview for uni months ago (she straight up just went ‘aww your dimples are so cute’ when I smiled) and I heard it from my new tutor in school although she was probably doing it more to tease me in front of the class. Just wondering if people find dimples on a guy attractive? I usually get older women in the 30s or something mention them to me and girls my age (18) only really mention them when I’m drinking with them so I’m not convinced these dimples really are ‘cute’ aha.

How do you deal with body shaming at either side of the scale?,"My aunt has been giving me a lot of grief lately for being too skinny (for context, I am 5’9” and weigh roughly 120 lbs) and goes around telling people that I am anorexic and need therapy.

Approaching a crying woman?,"A friend and I were eating outdoors today and noticed a woman visibly upset and crying.  I wanted to go see if she was alright or if she needed something.  She told me it was the last thing she would want.  I don't need to know her business just that she's safe and has the ability to get somewhere not in the middle of a public place (friends etc).  Maybe she got mugged, maybe her phone fell in the water (she wasn't on it), maybe she got left by someone can can't get home.  

To me walking over and just asking if she's ok and if she needs anything isn't a huge imposition but maybe I'm wrong.  My point was that I read an interview with someone who jumped off the bridge and he said that was crying in public and no one said anything.  Since no one gave a shit he ended up jumping which he regretted but thankfully survived.  I don't want that on my conscience when I can stop eating for like 15 seconds and just be sure.

What can I do to keep my breasts from sagging when I'm not wearing a bra at home?,"My breasts are DD cups, similar to my mothers size when she was my age. However, from a really young age, like, maybe around 12 onward, she started commenting on how my breasts tend to bounce when I walk (even though I've always a slow walker with small strides - I've noticed this too, even today still, and it really bothers me) and how they look like they'll sag, or would just straight up tell me they look saggy. What made my situation more dissapointing was when I tried talking my older sister, an A cup, about my issue. My sister, who has stopped wearing bras completely,  instead of hearing me out, tried to pressure me into not wearing bras (outside of the house) too, and when I tried to explain that it's personally uncomfortable for me and explain how with my breast size I can't afford to not have the support in fear of sag, an issue she doesn't exactly have to deal with on the same level as I do because our opposite sizes would sag at different rates over time, she was just completely unempathetic, and implying I shouldn't be complaining because she would love to have my breast size. After we talked, I did concede to not wearing bras at home, which had been more comfortable. That was about 5 years ago. I'm 22 now still live at home while Im going to college, and for almost a year I've been tying my tank tops tight around my neck to keep my breasts flat against my chest, so that when I'm walking down the stairs or bending over, the bounce and drop of my breast is greatly reduced when not wearing a bra at home.

I feel like a freak compared to other people whose nipples line up. I’ve had many relationships with no mention of them but now I’m insecure. 

Does anyone else relate and has this affected relationships?",1,"How many of us have uneven breasts and do men notice them?I have realized recently that my breasts are uneven by maybe a cupsize.

Babes! How do you deal with makeup rubbing off during sex?,"For those of us that wear makeup, that is. Obviously this wouldn’t be an issue in a relationship, but for ONS or new partners, I tend to be wearing makeup because we’re having sex at the end of a date or night out. 

I don’t care a ton about men seeing me without makeup, but I am embarrassed by product rubbing off onto their faces/sheets/etc. It’s like, oof, I made a mess!

What music streaming service do you prefer and why?,I’ve been using Spotify premium since forever and just wondered why others prefer other services. I’ve thought of Apple Music just because I can use it on my Apple Watch with my EarPods but don’t know if I can commit just because of all the music I have on Spotify. I also wondered if there were other streaming services I’m unaware of and should also look into. ,1,What music streaming service do you prefer and why?I’ve been using Spotify premium since forever and just wondered why others prefer other services.

Why do we not upvote any comments in r/askwomen??,"So my husband sometimes uses my phone to get on reddit when he runs out of data on his work phone. One day he casually mentioned to me that he has noticed that no one really upvotes each other’s comments on this subreddit even though we sometimes get super excited in certain threads and seem to agree with OPs. 

I’ve started noticing that the same thing happens in some of my other subreddits where it’s mostly women that are in there. Now I can’t stop thinking about so I figured I would ask. 

EDIT: so my husband and I are wrong. I didn’t know that upvotes can take a couple hours to show up. Lol I was really thinking there were never any upvotes but I was only seeing the newer posts.
